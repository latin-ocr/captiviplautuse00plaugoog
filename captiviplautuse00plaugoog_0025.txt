19. For a history of the vicissitudes of the text of Plautus in
antiquity, prior ιο the composition of A aud ΡΛ, our materiale are

too few. The variant readings already alluded to are to he referred
partly to the work ol scholars like Varro aud Valerius Probus,
partly to recastings hy stage managers ior the convenience of an
audienoe such as that addressed iu the prologus to the Occiae

(vv. ll sqq.):

studiose expetere uos Plautinas fabulas,
anticuam eius edimus comoediam,
quam uos probastis qui estis in senioribus;
nam iuniorum qui sunt non norunt, scio¹.

Evcn the question whether tho first collected edition of Plautus'
plays was made in the time of Varro (Usener in Nachrichl. Goltiuq.
Gcaellachafl 1892, p. 201) or in the time of Valerius Probus (Iso

evidence at our disposal.

ol Plautus and in the Augustan age;

(2) Plautus uses the ordinary colloquial forms ol everyday life,
whereas the diction of Augustan poetry was in great part an artificia]
language, with artificial forms, like our pronunciatiou oi the Noun
‘wind’ in poetry so as to rhyme with ‘mind'

Α Early Latin Peculiaritiea. The peculiarities oi Plautino

Prosody which belong ιο Early Latin, as opposed ιο Classical Latin
pronunciation, are these :-

1. Many final syllables were long by nature (ie. contained a
long vowel) in the time ol Plautus, which came later to be pro·
nounced with a short vowel, viz. :-
