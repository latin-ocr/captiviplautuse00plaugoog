⁶09. The MSS. offer Eo‚..inde abii mei abi. Various remedias of ne
line are possible. Ona is, to suppose the scribe of some archetypa to have
written abii (suggested by abii v. 506, acic v. 507) for ubi, and to have
corrected his mistake in the careless fushion of mediaavnl copyists us
true form of the line will then be:

Ec pretinm ad fratrem inda ubi mci nint atii captiui,

an Iambic Septenariua But the scansion protam ud isabnormal in an
Iambic line (Introd. iii. § 9). Iao follows Pylades in omitting inde abii and
prints an Iambic septenarius: Eo protinm ad fratr-dm mei ubi aaut ulii
captiui, which, if we admit elision of mei (Introd. ii. ξ 15), might be also
scanned as an Anapaestic Dimeter with Colon Reizianum. Leo adds tbc
explanation that Hegio's brothers house stood on the way from the
praetore quartem to Hegio's house, solbat praecunctor mum (v. 508) will
mean, ‘I take the road for homa' and protinas will signify, ‘without
departing from this rond! But to delete inda abii is too violent treatment
of the traditional reading. Aslighter change would be to read unde
ior iride: Eo pretinm ad fratrem, anda abii, mei ubl sucu alii captis&
(an Anapaestic Octonarius). This however requires us to suppose that
Hegio pnid a visit to his brothers house before going to the praetor, m
unlikely supposition (cf. vv. ‹ios—460). Probably itis the first word only
οἱ the line (nn Anapnestic Octonarius) which is conupt Some prefer
to delete abii ns an insertion by a scribe who failed to notice that ne
punctuation came after and not before inde.

511. Most editors change omnium to imminuat And yet the phrase
coquit omnium (cf. Men. 812 cuius rei reram omnium) is a permissible
phrase, not wholly unsuitable here, and we have no right to talu
liberties with the MSS. without carme. With omnium norit (cn the
spelling in the MSS. nouerit see note on v, 83 cf. Introd. ii. ξ 32) tha
last part of the line will ba a ‘colon licinianum.¹ With eminerammi
we have two Trochaic Dimetars catalectic
