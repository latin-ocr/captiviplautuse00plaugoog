divided into two volumes, the second 01 which contained the last
twelve plays This second volume, presumably owing to 0 defective
titlepage, fell into such neglect that at the Renaissance only
the first eight plays were known, and the discovery oi a MS.

which contained the last twelve was hailed as the discovery 01 a
lost classic.

5. The last twelve plays are iound 10 three MSS. :-

(B) the (lodex Vetus (containing also the first eight plays ; see
below). Thisis a ΜΒ, which belonged originally to some German
monastery and in later times to the Library 01 the Elector Palatina.
Itis now in the Vatican Library (with shelf-marlr Pol. lat. 1615).
Ῑ10 minuscule script of the German type is generally referred to the
end 01 the tenth century. The last seven plays (Pseud, Poen, Pera,
Ruri„ Stich, Trin, Truc.) were divided between several scribes, to
each 01 whom was assigned only a small portion to copy, with the
happy result that in these plays we have an extremely faithful re·
productiones the original, even without 0 corrector's sid. Ocr-
rections are frequent in the earlier plays (Bacch, Most, Men, to

the middle 01 the Miles) and retrieve the numerous errors 01 the
scribes. Butler the latter half 01 the Miles 'aud nearly the whole
01 the Mercator (to v, 1012) B cannot be regarded as so faithful 0
