an initial vowel, but is soanned as a short syllable. That this
treatment was a natural tendenoy of the language we see from
words like petendo for prae-hendo, comat comitium (but aestas),
οἱνοιὶᾱ (but eireitor, with elision) for cimam-it. A short vowel
is elidad, ag. morulam pronounoed aaav'olana, mammo pronounoed

39. So meagre and uncertain are our remains of Saturnian
Verse that it seems impossible to formulate with certainty the
precise laws of the matre, and it is dangerons to quote from them
precedente for any practice in Latin versification'. Still the patent
regard in that early metra ior the number of syllables in the line

eutitles one to say that it isat least probable that (l) a long final
vowel, (2) a final syllable ending in «m, were allowed in Saturnian
Ver-se to stand in this kind of Hiatus before an initisl vowel, as a
short final vowel would not be allowed, eg. patrem auam aspremont
mamam Ι appellat, lilre dabam naalma Metelli Naevio poetae. (For
details aee Anser·¹ Journ. Philet xiv. 309.)

In other branches oi Latin poetry we find the same practice, eg.

Virg. lid. viii. 108 oredimusl an qul imant ipsi sihi somnia -
linguntl

catull. xcvii 1 non (ita me dl liment) quicquam referre
putavi.

meae two soaneions are not artifioial scansione. They redeat the actual
pronuneiatiou ol these phrases in everydsy lile. In Plautus qui is similarly
heated in the phrases quiahoc, qui omont, qui habet, qai habent. dre. (lor
usuum, see Joum Phil. xxvi. 296), end the adjuration has the metrieal lorm
tte ne oi amr normally (lor instsnoes, see Hauler’s note on Ter. Pboou. 165).
