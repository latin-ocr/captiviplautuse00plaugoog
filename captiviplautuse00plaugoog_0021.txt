one of the two lines being written in red, the other in blech, end
Greek letters (motae personarum ') being prefixed to ench proper
neme¹. The seme Greek letters were used throughout the Scene to
indicate the speakers After-the first line oi the Scene-hesding
come the mark C, if the Scene was a Canticum, or DV if the Scene
was s Deverbium (Diverbium).

Since A is s palimpsest MS, anything thet was written in red
or other pigment hes been washed out, so thet sll thet hes been
left οἷ the Sceneheodings is the proper names, everything else having
probably been in red pigment. The ‘notse personerum’ throughout
the Scenes heve also disoppeered, only blank spaces remaining.

In PA most oi the Scene-hesdinge seem to hove hod their
complete equipment of names of persons, nsmes of rhles, ‘notes
personarum,' and the marks 0 or DV. But the frequent omission
end inaccurste statement of the proper names suggest thet in the
original from which PA wes itself derived, the proper names were
absent, perheps never having been filled in by the ‘rubricator’
Where they ore present in Pl, they hove been supplied with the
help oi the text. Proper names which do not occur in the text
could nothe supplied; end sothe nomes oi a lsrge number oi the
ohorscters in the plays, ior which the Sceneheedings of A heve not
been preserved, remain unknown to us (eg. oi the ‘metrone' in the
Menaechmi). The same process of supplying missing nsmes to the
Sceneheedings was carried on et various stsges in the transmission
of the Palatino text.

The Sceneheeding nomenclature in our minuscule MSS. hes
therefore no authority. Their ourious srsu1r10(·c10)of Cas. 11. iii,
111. iii, for which we find in A (st 111. iii.) the right nome,
nvslusuus, hus been obsurdly extrooted from two corrupt readings
ol the Palatino text, tibi stolitio for tittibilicio in v. 347:

non ego istuc uerbum empsim tittibilioio,

und stolicio for sto ilico in v. 960:
heus, sta ilico, amator.

eg. Pom. v. v. (K) ANTAMOENIDES EIDEM (·0·). (Seyffert in Bursien’s
