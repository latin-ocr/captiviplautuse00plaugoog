jalay'urdndum. 'l'hey do not eyen definitely inform us that these enclitia
or subordinate words gained an aocent of their own when immediately
followed by another enclitio, that, lor example, unde llel and quala Indoi
were uttered with acertain strecs in phrases like Mallum (Ep-'d 144. On
the monosyllabio pronunciation of aa& see Intr. ii. § 14), sequte eit drba'ter
(the ending of an lambio Senarius, Poeta 178), where they precede the
subordinate verbs labet (of. quilebet, pedaneo and ait. And while they
tell us that Intenogatives were accentad, they do not say whether the
accent of the interrogative (aa is the likely supposition) or of the Noun
was stronger in a question like quir laic bomon 1, which in Plautus always
takes the ictus on the quis and not on the first syllable of the subordinate
word horno (see below). It ie seldom that they condescend to such minutiae
ae the difference of meaning conveyed by the accentuations at quaudo and
(the usual) ai paruo, a differenoe pointed out by Donatus in his note on
Terence 1311114371

ln the absence of complete information about the accentuation of the
spoken Iatin sentence, it would be futile to attempt to compile exact
statistios of the number of lines in which this or that accented word or
syllable has or has not the ictus, and so it is difficult to demonstrate by
figurea the wonderful extant to which agreement of ictus and sentence-
acoent prevails in Plautus and Terence It can be recognined by anyone
who will take the trouble cf reading a play or two with his attention
directed to this point

13. In connexion with Enolitio Partioles, the remark of Servius (ad Aea
vi. 779) that millo was the current pronunciation has been already mentioned
(§ 7) as evidence of a return of the accent of a word to its usual pne
when the enclitio appendage was reduced hy elision, video (ia 1111111111)
like oldae (in everyday speech 11ᾱέ1). As domis an enclitio appendage of
the Imperative, eg. carate-dom Aul 646, mod-dum Most 679, aspicedum
Most 1106, so is aa (from oi oali). 'Phe normal incidence of ictus in Plautus

1891, p. 111.) Similarly the normal ictus primumdum (for instances see
Richardson, de ‘dom' parthulo, p. 13) seems to reflect the accentuation

14, Spellings like relocat, redueat shew ua that there need be no clash
of ictus and acoent in a phrase like salutationem Asin 320.

Nor can we find fault with the incidence of lotus in a phrase like
pauper-eum Aul. 88, αἰετόν-111111 Pseud. 1036, placituri-aunt Hec. prol 21.

15. The stressed and unstressed uses of the Latin Persona] Pronoun
have produced two series in the Romanoa languages, eg. Italian ‘me,’ ‘te'
emphatic, ‘mi' ‘ti' unemphatio. These unemphatio forms aru joined to
the verb, eg. metato mi 11 libro, ‘land me the book’ [ἰ something
