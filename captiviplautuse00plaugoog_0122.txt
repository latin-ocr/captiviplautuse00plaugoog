eidiphthongs throughout the text were deliberately ‘modernized' to 1, for
on the one hand the traces that remain 01 the older spelling are much
sewer than we should expect, and on the other we find now and then an a·

(Homoeoteleuton) 01 the neighbouring word (aarum), the commonest

employed in this sense in good Latin, does not occur stall in Plautus or
