the aooentuetion oi everydoy life, eg.

Oapt. 837 cedo manum Manum? Manum, inquam, &u
lieet. 596 Non det, non debeb Non mbas, &a
him eso-1
Ad eaput omnis, quod de eaelo exoritur sub solid iouia
sub solio Iouis? Iba dieo, dre. Α

similarly in shouting, eg.
Mem 432 Eho, Mmmid! aooede huo l, ho,

end in the exclamation (usrully) el mili (ior details aee Richter in Stude
mund's Studien i. p. 470).

8. The other oleas ol words which aooented the final syllable oonsists
of those whioh have eontractod their two last syllables into one eg. nmo-ds
from monronis (the Plautino form), abu from αὺιοίι These connected
Perfecta lake normolly ihe iebus on their final syllable in Plautus and
Terence

9. Of trisyllables, we have seen that tribraohworda (like tribraob
wordendings) ere never used withan iebus on their seoond mllable, eg.
penho, while daoiylwords ere oooasionally allowed with this incidendo
of iebus by Plautus (noi by Terenoe) in ihe first looi oi an lambio line or

hemistioh, eg. pectdrn Molossus-words aro nob infrequenb with iebus on
the first syllable when iheir final syllable is elidad, eg. Ter. Andr. inin:

poeta odmprim(um) anim(um) ad sorlbend(um) appulit,

this disompanoy ol icius and nocent being regarded es loss unpleesani than
a double discreponoy like scribendum. of. lnlr. iii. ξ 7 on the toleranoe ol
‘oommot(em)' &o (as opposed ιο ‘commotum’ unelided) in the ‘even' feel
of lambio and ihe ‘odd' feet of Troohaio lines (Introd. iii. ξ 7).

Bentley’s (and Hermenn'a) theory thot in reading Latin poelry the nocent
was shifted a syllable neorer the beginning oi a word, whose last syllable was
elidad, would produoe in thie line ol Terenoe on erant eorrospondenoe ol aooent
and iotus; lor cumprimum would become by the elision ol tho final coinrpn'mmm),
and scribendum would be pronounoed rcribemilum) from the same eausa Bul
the theory lecke confirmation end seems on the faoe ol il ιο be very unlikely ιο
meet wilh any. (On Klota's equally unsuooeaeiul attempt ιο explain in thia
wey soaneions like proslcllo). see Inir. ii. 5 29.)

'l'ho reason ior Plautus' toleretion ol the iotus pectora hul not ol genero may
have been that eword like genera could easily oooupy some other part ol the
line, whereas, sinos en anapaestos the form νν, -, eg. peoltora euripum, isnol
legitimote in lambio verse, daotyl-words would lind greater difficulty in gaining
admission. Theletus is reedily tolereied on the final syllable ol a tribraoh (and
dactyliolword. The question however ol the incidenoe ol iotus (and acuent) on final
syllables rather belongs ιο the subjeol ol enclitios and ιο Sentenoeooeentuation.

10. Ol qradrisyllables words ol the form mx, eg. balineae, which
us we have seen, retained in Plenius' time their early aooenbuation of ibe
fist syllable, have the ictus also on this first syllable es a rulo in the verses
