remarks oi tho flrst sud second speakers in lines with hiatus or with syllaba
auosps, at the close oi the first apeeker'a οιιοηοοος whereas, with elisium,
the second speaker may be supposed ιο begin at the moment that the drst has
dnished. Varro appears to have recommended tho use ol tha sign Ι (e vertice!
stroke) ιο iudicate syllcbe auceps (aud histustl dne ιο a pause (sm Lar. ir.
hag. 74, ΨίΙιο.); quare in huiuscemodi locis poni oportet uotam Ι transversam
iuter syllabas, frequentius ad extremum vsraum senarium et similas, si pro
longe brevem habebunt extremam, utin hou:

amicus summus meus et popularia Geth.

Itis possible thet traces of this symbol survive in our MSS. oi Plautus (see
Schoell's Introd. ιο Proculeium, p. xxxin).

43. Even where there is no change of speaker theru may be as
marked an interval between two utterunoes oi the seme speaker.
This will make our fifth form of Hiatus,

(5) when the seme speaker resumes after sn interval. For
example, in Poen. 685 Lycus eddresses the first part of the line to
the audience, then going up ιο Oollabisous he addresses the second
mmmmm:

Blande hominem compellabo. l hospes hospitem
Salutat, ho. (ΑΡ),

where the interval would iu en English play be indicated by stage
directions, thus:

LYO. (οεὶάο) Blande ho. (to Collohiaeus) hospes dre.
Of. Stich. 270:

sed eccum Pinacium, eius puerum. Ι hoo uide (ΔΡ).

Similerly in Most. 484 Tranio first requeets the attention of
Theopropides, then aiter a pause begins hia story:

Ilgo dicem: ausculta Ι ut foris cenduerat
Tuos gnitus, dre. (P, A π. l).

44. There is a danger oi being over-fanuiful in these matters,
und of attributing modern stageoouventiona oi enunciatiuu to the
ancient delivery of quantitative verse with or without musical
eccompaniment. Still there may be werrant for adding other
cases, more open to question, in which hiatus may have been

tolerated by Plautus :—

(6) Any marked pause in the line, where utterenoe would observo
the intervals of aetion or gesture, such as
