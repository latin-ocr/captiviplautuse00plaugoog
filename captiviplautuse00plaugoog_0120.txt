ARGVMENTVM.

mmm The aryumma (ὑποθέσεις, περιοχαῖ) prefixed io
the plays of Plautus and Terence are not the work of these authore
themselves The Terence capitanata, which are non-acrostie and conciet
invariably of la lambic Senarii‚ were compoeed in the ind century an.
by O. Sulpicius Apollinaris, the contemporary of Fronto and the toacher
of Aulus Gellius end oi the Emperor Pertinax. The authorship oi the
Plautus argema is unknown. They ane oi two kinds: (l) Non-acrostic,
ior the Perea, Pseudolus and Stichus in the Ambrosian Palimpseet, and
ior the Amphitrite, Aulularia, Mercator and Miles Glorioaas in the other
MSS„ the MSS. of the ‘Palatina' family, (2) Acroetic, for all the plays in
the ‘Palatina' MSS. (See introd i. ξ lb.) And there is thie nctuble
difference between the two, that the Amostic verses, unlike the Non·
ecrcstie, freely admit Hiatus, an admission due to the erroncous theory
that Hiatus was not avoided in the archaia poetry¹. In the Aci-ostie
hgumem before ue therefore tha Hiatus in v. l pagna Ι Hegionis, and
v. b aeti Ι emit, cannot oi iteeli suggest that the reading of the MSS.
requires emendation. Itis merely a pseudo-archaism. So is the spell-
ing of the Acroetic itselt, nimivm instead of caraman ln the time of
Plautus the diphthong ei was not used indiscriminataly ior any long
ieound as it wae in the time of Lucilium but the simple vowel was used
ior original t, the diphthong for ei (whether originally οἱ or aior m).
