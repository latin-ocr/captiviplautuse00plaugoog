280. The line cannot romain as the MSS. present it, for Aleis as a
third ioot is impossible Schoell’s double transposition tamo ei iu Al '
erun gratia deols ιοο violently with the reading of the MSS„ and more
legitimate transpositione like tauta gratia ci cum iu Aleia or, simpler still,
οἱ cum tauto iu Alcis gratio, produce doubtful rhythns To suppose with
Brix that Alcis, a rare example oi the correct form (see note on v. 9), can
have come inte the text as a gloss or es a corruption of illus is quite
unreasonabla The explanation that tant, which seems ιο be capable oi
being used by Plautus with a Noun (eg. Pers. 533), has been ousted by the
gloss or grammatical correction tauta, is the best that hes yet been offered,
though it is open ιο the objection that tam pratia cat in Plautus means ‘no

cannot but acquiesce in Camerarius' correction of optume (oc) to opimae
The old spelling optumae (with u) offers a difficulty, sceing that the habit
oi mediaeval scribes was rather ιο modernize the archaic spellings that
they found in their original. We should expect ιο find optim (oe) in our
Mss, (ci critical note on s. 769). I suppose that the neighbouring Super·
lative with the older spelling (boncrotissumum v. 278) suggested the older
form, unless it is due ιο the similarity of im and um in minuscule (and
other) script Unde excoquat sebum senex seems rather a poor
joke It may be some proverb, the exact sense of which isnow lost ιο un
