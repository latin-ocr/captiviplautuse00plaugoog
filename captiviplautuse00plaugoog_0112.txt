and in 169 ννννν (anaclastic) ορατ quietas We have another

certain Ionic passage in the penultimate Scene of the Pseudolus,
ag. ν. 1275τ

probe Ionica 1 perdidici Ι sed palliollotim αννίονιιι,

though the text of the neighbouring linea is unfortunately not free
from uncertainty.
In the Greek Drama the Bacchiae is associated with thelonio

rhythm. Thus the hymn of the Mystae in the Froqs of Aristophanes
begins (v. 320:
Ἴακχ’ ὦ Ι πολοτιμήφτοις ἕδραις ένιθιέδε ναίων,

with the first foot a Bacchius (ost). Similarly in Plautus the
Sotadic passage just quoted from the Amphitruo is followed by

Bacchiae Tetmmetem, and the Pseudolus passage has Bacchiacs in
close proximity.

49. The Oolon Reiziannm, of which there are several types,
(1) vua-⁸, (2) 0·vv··v, (3) ννννννν δὶα, appears ln Aristo-
phanes as the catalectic form of an acephalous Glyconic. Thus in
the Kaiqhta, vv. llll-4, we have three ‘acephalous' Glyconios
(ie. Glyconics wanting the first syllable) followed by the Oolon
Reizianum:

σκέψασθε tl μ’ εἶ σοφῶς

αὖτοὺς περιέρχομαι

τοὺς οἰομένους φρονεῖν
καί μ’ ἐξαπατύλλειν,

and similarly llcol. 291-3:
ἀλλ’, ὦ Χαριτιμιδη
καὶ Σμίκυθε καὶ Δράκης

It follows an Iambic Dimeter in such passages as Act. 840:
ἣ συκοφάντης ἄλλος, οἲφΙμιέζων καθεδεῖται,

and Pax 954 :

φυσῶντι καὶ πονουμένῳ ss προσδώσετε δή που.

This composite line (Iambic Dimeter with Gelon Reizianum), called
the Versus licinianus, is not infrequent in Plautus. ln contrast to
