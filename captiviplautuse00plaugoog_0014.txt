ψ Ι. THE MANUSORIPTS OF PLAUTUS.

1. Our Mss. of Plautus belong to two families. Of one family
the only representative is

(A) the Ambrosian Palimpsest, a MS. probably oi the Irish
Monastery oi Bobbio in N. Italy, now in the Ambrosiau Library,
Milan (with shall-mark θ 82 supa). It is written in Capitol letters of
the fourth, possibly the third century, but its original writing was
effsced from its pages, and a new text, a portion oi the Old Testament
(l Kinge-2 chron), was written upon them in thc 7th or 8th century.
Though it contained originally all the twenty-one ‘Varronian' plays
of Plautus, the plays declared by Varro to be universally accepted
as genuine, many leaves have boen lost, including the whole of the
Amphitruo, Aunesis, Aulularia aud Curculio, and nearly the whole
oi the captiva· and Vidulum Of the leaves that romain many are
wholly or in great part undeciphcrable‚ aud all have offered more or
less difficulty to collators. The best preserved plays are the Stichus,
Persa, Pomulos, Pseudolus and Trtnmomue. A lull description ol
tha MS. and an apograph of its text will be found in Studemund‚
Codicis Recepti Ambrosiam' Apoyropbum, Berlin, 1889.

2. The other family, usually called the ‘Palatino' family,
includes a number ol Mss. in minuscule script, all derived from
alost archetype which we may designate ΡΔ :-

(T) the Codex 'lhrrnsbi or Fragmenta senonensia, a fragmentary
MS. (ol the 9th or loth century probably), which belonged to the
Benedictins Monastery of S. Uolombe at Sens in Central Franco,
and eras used hythe French scholar Adrion Turnhbe in the sixteenth
century. The MS. seems to have been destroyed shortly after
lhrnebe’s use ol it.. Besides the few isolatod readings which he
