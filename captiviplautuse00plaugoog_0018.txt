linea to a page (ἓ 7), and which may have been the first part oi ΡΨ.

9. The text oi D ie precisely of the same value ae the text oi B
in the earlier playa (eea Gilleepie in limare Sindica ix. 109). But
throughout the firet eight playa B hae received certain correctione,
which I propoee to denote by the symbol B'. These corrections, unlilre
the conectiona in the first four ol the laet twelve playa, and unlilre
those correctione which are properly marked Β* in the iirat eight,
have been taken, not from the common original (1³⁸⁰) oi B and D,
but from another MS. of great value, which contained various lines

(eg. Aac. 454) that had been omitted in 1³⁸⁰, and which preserved
the genuine reading in numerous cases of corruption in ΡΜ). Thia

MS. waa however a descendant oi the came archetype aa ΡΜ), and
may indeed have been the actual original from which 1²⁸¹> wae
copied¹. Ii 1²⁸⁰ and 1³⁰¹> were the firat and second hali oi one MS„

it ia conceivahle that the eource of the B³·correctiona waa the iirat
hali oi the MS. P.

It ia plain that the acribee oi a, when beginning the taalr oi copying, had an
original which contained only the liret eight playa. They began their work on
what ia now iol 9, and on the reverse aide' oi that leel wrote a title: la boc
wlumiuc cornicantur comediee plauti namne aiii, with a liat oi the flrat eight
playa (Ampb.-Epid.). When the laet twelvc playa were added and the Querolm
(a late imitationes Planina) prefixed by the earne etad oi acribee, that title and
liat were enred, and on the firat page ol tho quaternion which was prefixed with
the Qoerelua anew title waa written: lu hec columine contineatur cmuedice pleuti
namo rai, with a full liet of the playa beginning with the Querolue (hence
‘twentyona’ not ‘twenty ’)‚ and with a slight break in the liet between the
Epidion and the Bacchides. The nature of B may be explained on the hypo·
theria that the acribea began with an original (Ψ) which contained the flret

. eight playa only; that a new MS. (Ρ), containing all twenty playa (perhaps with
the Querotue prefixed), and being ltaeli the original irom which 1³¹⁰ had been
copied, wae brought into requisition ior the correction ol B; that irom thie new
us. the laet twelwe playa (with the Querolm) were copied, and tbe old title with
the liat cl eight playa waa replaced by a new title with a iull liat. For the
aecond part oi the Ma. no lreeh original oi equal importance waa available. and
the rarione correctore of thia part need the actual original from which the copy

waa made‘.
