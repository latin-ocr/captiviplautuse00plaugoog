Μ, (b) Dactyl Μ, (6) Prooelerrsmatic ⁴⁹⁹⁹. There is no roem for au
ictus like ⁴-, to reprcduoe the accurate pronunciaticn cf a disyllabis· word
like sero, with short accented first syllable and long final syllable This
discrepancy firmishes the opponente of Bitschl's dictum with their strongast
argument How is it possible, they ask, to ascribe an accentual clement
to the verse of Plautus, when by the very nature of the metre used, the
acoent of those numerous iambic disyllables of common use would resist
adaptaticn to the ictus or beat of the verset Another argument, as
frequently used as this one, is that an lambio line must end with an
Iambus (2²), which implica an ictus on the final syllable of tha line,
whereas an secent on the final syllable of a word is contrary to the latin
practice; and these two arguments are regarded by many persons as oon
clusive. And yet the very fact that Plautus evidently takes the greatoet
possible pains to cvemome these two difficulties in the way of reconciling
ictus and occant, is one of the strongest proofs that he aimad at such
reconciliation. Iet us examine his methods of dealing with these Iambus
worda

(l) In the first placa, he avails himself cf the tendanoy of latin
pronunciation to shorten their final syllable, a tendency which ΜΝ
itself most strongly in those ending with a long vowel followed by gt
(eg. serdr, ferdi), and in many words which, ending in along vowel, were
closely joined with other words in ordinary rapid utterance, eg. cavesdn's
domimo, domhcenic, dabdplcqam, deciperem, datbpbtqom, cite-cum,
moddcerrtprobe-sdctm. (On this Law of Breves Breviantesseelntriillt)

(2) Or secondly, hs sc places them in the sentence that their nocent
is divertod from the first syllable, whether to the final, eg. ὂοκοέᾳιι,
homene, homere, benafrum, molae-ree, sistendos, or to a preceding word,
ag. loc-nwdo (like quomodo), aliqua-modo, mctarndcbo.

(3) Thirdly, he elides their final vowel.

The usual place to which he assigna an Iambus-word, scanned cs an
Iambus and with marked conflict of ictus and nocent, is before a pause
in the sentence, especially in the first foot of an Iambic line, eg. liin
1-2:

A. Sequere hac me, gnata ut miluus fungaris tuoun
B. Sequor. sed finem fere quem dicam nescio,

where the disagreement would probably not be sc marked. Before the
last Dipody of the line, eg. Aac. 581 Atque istuc aurum qued tibi meed-
tumet, and (the most frequent situation) at the end cf a line lambio words
are preferred which would in ordinary utterance heve no perceptible
accent, eg. tucca, tibi in the lines quoted above, which would be as much
unaccented disyllables as the -scic of necin Cf. heo-modo, alqcomodc
weram-dabo, sacriscrinio, &o lt is rarcly that we find an lambio word
at the end of a line to be an important word in the sentence asin
