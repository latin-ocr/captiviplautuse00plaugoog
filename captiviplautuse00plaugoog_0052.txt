is surely unreascnable The scansion of a Latin line was determined
by the Latin pronunciation of a sentence, not by a musicconductor’s
indication oi the ‘time ’. This theory that the shortening of syllables
through the Breves Breviantes Law was due to ictus has led many
oi its supportare to the strange idea that Plautus allowed a Trochaic
septenarius (Sciet. 700, quowd in 5 17) to begin with the word
amica, scanned as a tribrach. The incidenoe of the ictus on the first
syllable oi the line, they say, caused the word to sound (in this
particular line) amica instead of amico. But if (as they allow) the
word was invariably pronounced critica by a Roman, how could the
mere wielding of a conductor's baton legitimize a mispronunciation
like amicat This extreme form oi the theory, which seems hardly
worth discussing, has been already noticed in 5 17. ‘Here we have to
consider a more plausible hypothesis, which ascribes to the ictus a
negative, rather than a positive, voice in the scansion of a line.
In the case of certain syllables which in ordinary pronunciation were
deprived oi their full ‘long' quantity and cn occasion assumed or
carne near to assuming the ‘short' quantity, the ictus of the line, it
is supposed, might interiere to prevent the syllable from playing this
maamad part. The words abi mole accipiar were so pronounced
hy Roman lips that the true iambic sound of ubi was obscured and
the word fell on the car almost like a pyrrich. A poet had thus the
option oi treating the word as a pyrrich, when it pleased him todo
so, instead oi as an iambus. According to this hypothesis, he would
abstain from availing himself of this licence in certain circumstances.
He would, for example, have no hesitation in beginning a trochaic⁸
line with the tribrach ddi mett, but would avoid, as inharmonious,
the same tribrachopening of an iambic line οἱοί mdt.

Even this modified formos the theory seems to me to ascribes potency to
the ictus in Latin verse which it could only have in the sing-song repetition oi
Roman school-children. Plautus manned the words ubi male accipiar as he
pronounced them. Il his pronunciation ol uti in this context varied on occasion
between att and uti, or was consistently half-way between the two scansions, he
admitted the one or the other according to metricsl exigencies. In this case the
matre toleratm both ποῖ and uti, and the only consideration that would deter-
mine his metrical treatment oi the word would be his notorious predilection ior
an identity oi ictus and secent (see Appendix). Il we can prove that the rhythm
att male accipiar mors exactly reproduced the intonation os these words in
ordinary discourse than ποῖ’ male accipin, then we heve all the justification we
need lor believing the first loct oi the line to be a tribrsch. The dialogus
matres usually leave us without definite indication of the quantity in such
cases, and we cannot appeal to the other matres used by Plautus, for in
