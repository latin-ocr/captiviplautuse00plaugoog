908. Propemodum, ιο judge from ite Plautine use, has much the
same sanae as focile. For the repetition cf. ag. Mero. 67 extemplo-
confestim

959. rua ex re facies—ex mala meliusculam. The last words
seem to be added as an asterthought and are not quite in keeping with
tac aa· re facim, ‘you will benefit yourself’ (ag. Mea 681 ec re tuo seceris).
They would naturally have as a preliminary triam rem, ‘you will put your
affairs out of a bad into a slightly better condition' The Preposition es
has a slightly different sense in the two parts of the sentence (cf. ad
v. 908). Leo punctuates altarre:

Si eris uerax, tua ex re, facies ex mala meliusculam,

leaving socies to be supplied iu the first phrase. The words aa mala
melimelum have been with much likelihood assigned ιο Stalagmus In
that case they will be the incentive ιὸ Hegio’s nejoinder recte el uera loqroera
(Iud), which, as the passage is printed in this edition, is a command
(loquere Impar.). Brix boldly transfers vr. sos-9 to the place oi v. 968, so
that w. 960 follows immediately on vv. ess-7.

960. Baete et uera. Ter. Ad. 609 Ει recte et nanim dicis For the
combination of Adverb and Adjective in colloquial Latin cf. v. 271, thiu
268 Summam quos miseros maleque larbam, Pseud. 110, Asia. 567 sq. The
defective matre is easily remedied by the insertion of the pronoun ta,
which should be joined immediately to the Negative‚ l'or aeqrw epo, mque
tu (sometimes with the intervention of torota, edepol, dic) is the normal
arrangement in Plautus, ag. Mera 960 Neque epo lauceio rwqrae papam
acque epo luis coepto (for other examples see Kaempf, dc Proitou-ianm
Panormitam Usu at Collocasiona Berl 1888, p. 41). Ta would more easily
drop out before a of aare than before recte. Besides, the ictus will fall on
ea in this position in the line, and that sirits the emphasis which would
attach to the Pronoun in this sentence Schoell places tu after the second
mqroe and before recte.
