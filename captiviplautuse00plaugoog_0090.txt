exhibit a reconciliation of natural acuent and metrical ictus which
is gained by the sacrifice of the Greek requirement of frequent
Dioeresis This latin type (called ‘dactylio' by Marius Victorinus)
would be the product of a long experienoe, just as the adaptation oi
the Greek Elegiae (see Appendix) was the work ol successive genera·
tions oi poets. Pioneem, like Plautus, in the adaptation oi the Greek
metrae to Latin poetry‚ would not readily hit upon the proper device
for turning out smooth lines. And so it is in his Anupaestic Metres
that we find the most marked discrepancy between natural accent
and metrical ictus in the poetry oi Plautus It seems difficult to
believe that the same poet, who in other metres so successfully
reconciles secent with ictus, should tolerate lines like:

Trita 239 blandiloquentfilus, harpagb, mendkx,
Bacch. 1088 stulti, stolidi, fatui, fungi, Η bardi, blennl, buccones
Para. 753 hostibus uictis, ciulhlls saluis, etc.

And yet we must remember that the Greek requirements of tho
metra, wia diaeresis usually at the end of the ‘metrum’ and always
at the end of the hemistich‚ were requirements which necessitated
in any Iatin linc constructed on this pattern a constant ffiscrcpancy

between ictus and secent. Lines like these oi Anaxandridea (frag.
xli. 39 sqq. Κ.) :

πουλυποδείων, χολίκων, δημοῦ,

φυσκῶν, ζωμοῦ, τκυτλῶυ, θρκῶυ,

θνννιῧες ὀπταί, φυκίδες ἕφθαῖ,
could not be exaotly reproduocd except by lines like the above. No
doubt a good many verses (eg. Tria. 239l) have been referred to
Anapaestic Metre in Plautus which really belong to other metres (eg.
Dactylic l); ior the tendency ol Ritsohl’s time to declaro every verae
that wemed difficult oi scansion to be Trochaio has been succeeded
by a tendency to call them all Anapaestic. Still it remains an
undoubted lact that a large number oi passages, unmistakeably
Anapaestic, shew the most pronounced disregord of the word· and ’
sentenoeaocent. Inierences with respect to the accentuation oi
latin words cannot therefore be saiely made from Anapnestic lines,
except in the case oi the Iaw oi Breves Breviantes (ii. ς 23). That the
