a 11110 111 1110 MSS. represents a line 01 two lines or e line aud a half of the
original In this Canticimr, however, short lines ars frequent in 1110 MSS
(eg. vv. 107, 204, 200, 200, 2061, hc), so that we may conclude that the
older distribution has hardly, if at 011, been departed from.

Another difficulty is thet wc bevenot specimens extant of the models
on which the Plautina Cantica were constructed (luti-od, iii. ξ 2). These
must have been developements of the 0110111000 of the later Attio (11010011010,
Euripides end his successors, but how precisely they had divergcd from the
original type we cannot tell. An editores Plautus is always exposed to the
danger of associating metres whose association Plautus would never have
tolerated‚ or of imposing 0 scansion on lines which is made possible by the
clastic prosody of Pleutine Latin, but which Plautus never intended 1110
line 10 bear.

The arrangement in this edition supposes the Canticum 10 begin with
an Iambic passage, Octonarii (Tetramsters Accielectic) varied in v. 197 by
a Dimeter and terminated by a Septenarius (Tetr. Οο101)ν.200. The
transitiou 10 Cretics (vv. 204 sqq.) is marked by the Thochaic lines (v. 201
aud probably v. 203), which arc intenupted by e reversiou to the lambio
rhythm in v. 202, where a proverbial merim 10 put in lts natural setting,
an lambio Senarius The Cretic passage is interrupted hyan Iambic
ι00110’(1.206“,011 lambio Dimeter), and is terminated by an Ithyphallic
colon (v. 207 sentio...qqitis), which is found elsewhere at the end of Oretics
(eg. cere. 121, Pseud. 264), Two Trochaic Octonarii couvey Tyndarus’
