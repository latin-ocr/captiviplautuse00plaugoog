mom usual. There is no example oi hiatus in these passages, but
we may quote as an instance:

Men. 968 ut ibsenie ero rem 1 erl diligenter.

‘Syllaba aneeps’ is slso tolerased at the diaeresis, eg. Tmo. 463:
uosmet iam uidetis, ut ornata incedo.

(2) The ersis immediately preeeding the diaeresis is rarely
rewlved. (In the Amplior-tw passage we seem to find an exemplo
of thia resolution, v. 570:

perdiu Quid mall sum, ἕνέ, ΙΙ tua ex re promeritus l)

In other ivonis, a second paeon or ionic a minore is avoided in

the seeond ieet, as at the end oi the line. (For the possible

substitutos ior a bacchius end the restrictions oi their use see
27-9.

For details oi the Diaeresis oi Beeehise Testamenta, ses Klotz, Grumum,

The Oatsleetie form oi the Tetrameser is occasionally found.
For instance, ai the close of a passage in Aeetaleetie Tetrameters
we heve Poen. 244:

olent, salsa sunt, langere dt non uelle,
with she last foot, salis, eateleetio.

32. 'l'he Beoehiee Dimeter is by no means rare. The first Scene ol the
seeoud Aet of the Trinummo begins with nine Baoohiae Testameters followed
by the Dimatar (ι. 232):
