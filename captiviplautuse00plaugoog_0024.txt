in what seem te be errore oi text, the theory has been formulaled that
A and ΡΔ were closely connected, both coming from one and the same
original (not necessarily an immediate original) which had its margins
supplied with variants, and that the points of differenoe between A
and P* are due to the scribes of the two Mes. having selected their
text now irom the margin, and now from the text oi this common
original. (See Leo, Plorat. Forachaaqea, chap. i.) Some theorists have
even gone so iar as to speciiy the number of lines on each page of
this supposed original with the help of seeming lacunae in A and ΡΛ.
And yet, iiwe consider how numerous must have been the copies of
Plautus in the Empire, especially aiter the study oi theold Republiean
writers becanm the iashion, it isacarcely credible that oar two MSS,
the one apparently Italian, the other probably French, should be so
closely related. The whole tenor of recent Plautina study has shewn
that what seemed at first sight to be errors common to A and 1²*
have usually turned out to be genuine readings, and that the saiest
mle for an editor is te accept any reading supported by both A and Pe,

, unless there is clear possibility oi the scribe of A aud some scribe of
a Palatina archetype, whether of PA or P or PBD, dre, having fallen
separately inte the same mistalre. There may be a iew scribal
errore which were present in some very early edition oi Plautus, and
which have found their way by direct transmission into both A and
ΡΑ, but they are unlilrely to be much more numerous than the mis·
prints repesoed ior some generations in editions, let ua say, of
Shalrespeare or Milton A study of the divergent readings of A
and P* leaves the impression rather ol two different editions which
had in many passages been assimilated through the adoption by one
oi some readings oi the other, than oi two copies oi the same edition
which were beginning te exhibit points oi dissimilarity ¹.

¹ A list ol disergent readings ol Δ and Ρ* will be found in Niernayer, de
Plauti fahalomm recensione duplici, Berlin, 1877 (cl. Beier, de Plauti fabularum
mevaniae Ambrosiam et Palatina, Breslau‚ 1885). The list is capable oi
im rement. Some readings are attributed to ΡΑ, which tha evidence oi 'l' shows
to mers errore oi P; some readings assigned to awill be struck out aiter raiar-
ence to Studemund's Apogrsph. The aim ol both traatises is to decide whetherA
or lt* is the better authority lor the text oi Plautus. lt is now generally admitted
that both MSS. had their strong and wesls points, and that each reading must be
judged onita own merite. Tha passages quoted by Nonius lrom Plautus have
been collected by Caesar, de Plauti matoria opud Nonium sensata, in vol. xi. ol
the Dissertationer Philolopr'cae Argentorareaea, Strassburg, 1894. Here too the
readings must be tested by a reference to Onions’ edition ol Nonius i.-iii.
(Oxiord 1895), and hy consideration whether this or that reading is not rather
to be regarded as a mistalre ola mediaeval scribe than as the actual text ol
Nonius For the Plautina passages quoted by Festus, see Leidolph‚ de Festi et
Paua locis Plautinis, dana, 1888.
