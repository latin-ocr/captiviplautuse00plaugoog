The Versus Reizianus for example, a characteristic type in
Roman Comedy, used in continuone passages by Plautus (5 49),
is found in Aristophanes Pax 954 and elsewhere:

φυσῶντι καὶ πονουμένῳ ΙΙ προσδώσετε δήπου.
The curicus couplet at the opening oi the Persa:

οιι ames egens egressu ae princeps in Amore usa
superauit aerdmnis ιο suis aerumnas Herculi,

appears in Lysistr. 299-301 &ca

κᾶσπιν γε Λήμνιον τὸ πῦρ τοῦτο πάσῃ μηχανῇ.
οὐγὰρ ἅν ποθ’ ὧδ’ ὀδὰξ ἔβρυκε τὰς λήμας ἐμοῦ.

The ‘Versus Diphilius' (Leo-tovJ-UocJ-co-), eg. Aris-
toph. Pac 775:

Μοῦσα σιν μιν πολέμους ἀπωσαμένη μετ’ ἐμοῦ,
has been recognised in Οιινο. 96-7:

flos ueteris uini meis naribus obiectust.
eius amor cupidam me huc proliclt per tenebras,

and in Cas. 644¹:
iam tibi istuc cerebrum disparentiam, excetra tu

(On the curicus lines in the Stielana, vv. ll sqq, which seem ιο be
modelled upon acephalous Glyconics in combination with the Oolon
Reizianum‚ as in Aristoph. Eq. 1141 sqq, Εοσί. 291 sqq„ see 5 51,
on the ‘ChoriamboTrochaics' οι Bacch. ιν. ιιι. see 5 42.)

4. But a large number of features οι the Greek Dramatic
metros are inevitably absent from the Latin. The old associatione
οι various metros must have been lost. Anapaests could no longer
be recognired by a Roman audience as the metre appropriate toa
march (ξ 25), nor Cretica as the conventional form οι a hymn to
Apollo. Syncope, or the suppression (ie. merging in a neighbonring
long syllable) οι a short thesis, is hardly to be looked ior in the
Iambic and Trochaic parts of Plautus' Cantica3 and though this or
that special type οι syncopated verse, which had become popular
on the Alexandrian stage, may be repnoduced by him, its true
nature was probably not recognized. The opening line οι the
Persa, quoted above, was ιο Plautus probably an Iambic Dimeter
Acatalectic (qui οινιάιιι, cyane inpressas est) followed by a Trochaic

¹ The Casina was an adaptation of the Glemnuooe of Diphilus (θαι. prol. 82).
