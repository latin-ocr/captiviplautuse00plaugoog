22 That the irsual position of subordinate (lonjunctions like aad et, st

of Plautus ln the first 600 lines of-let us say—the Amphitruo au instance
of ot, ‘that’ ‘aa’ with the ictus can hardly be found, except in phrases
lilre alludet (v. 396), where it would have the main aocent oi the word·
group (cf. podivin, pauet), and decidam· (v. ³34), where it would have
a secondary accent

2& of Word-grcupa the Grammarians mention some, eg. respublica,
ica-iurandum, dcc, and the Romanoa languages point to others, eg. font
fuam (0. Ital sarsore, Fr. sorsoire), addianodorom (Ital allero, Fr. olm)
A word-group ol adjective and Noun was apparently molo m in the
phrase i ia molam mmm, ‘go and be hanged‚' for the group may bs
qualified by an Adjective, i ia maerorum molam cracem. 'l'hs accentuaticu
maldra-mecm is reflected by the normal ictus (ior details see Luchs in
Studemund’s Studien i. pp. 18 sqq.). Other groups of this type are
probably bono-fides, molo-fidos, magnummolom. The laet is a common
ending of alins in Plautus, who in Most. 670 admits hmmofids to thesemo
position, in spite of the law against a diiambic ending (Intr. iii ξ 8> 'lo
the word-groups of Numeral and Noun, like tresviri vermeria, we may
perhaps add expressione of time like cipiottdiea mpiatddies (cf. our
‘lortnighw ‘twelvemouth’)‚ or of velue, like viginti-minae, triginta-rainae
(cf. our ‘sirpence,' ‘twopeuce'). The normal ictus in the 'Dramatistsis

· triginta dio, apina minoe, dic, although cipime', triyim when not used
in such collocatione, show the ictus which we should expect, triginti, raptus
(Skutsch, Foraat. 'a 162). On operaepretium see Bryant in Humani
Stadios ri.

24. But this theory of Plautus’ regard lor Acoent, in addition to
Quantity, must not be pushed to en extrema There is just ao much dis
regard of Accent as to produce what Ritschl happily calls the ‘hermonische
Disharmouie’ of Plautina verse. Thus when two words are contrasted
with each other, they have both as a rule the metrica] ictus, as they would
in everyday speech have a marked accentuation‚ eg. Ildum aum aon Oedipus,
Ter. Arulr. 194, aud the absence of this feature often indicates o corruption

in the line. Still the rule is not slavishly followed It is sometimes dis
regarded intentionally, eg. mn. 59:
