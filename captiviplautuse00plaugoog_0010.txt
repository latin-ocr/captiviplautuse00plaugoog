PREFAOE.

Since the Captivi 10 the one play 01 Ρ100100 10 whose text
ere represented ell¹ the pre-Roneissence 1188, Ι 11ον0 thought
it worth while 10 re-collete the MSS.² 101 this edition end
provide 0 1011 apparatus criticus. The gleaning 01 the field
already reeped hy the authors 01 the lergcr Teubner edition
has 001 been mis-spent lehour. It has contributed not merely
to the improvement 01 the text, especially in the metter 01
orthography⁸, but to e 0100101 knowledge 01 the reletionship
between the MSS. 01 the first eight pleys.

The introductory peges deal mainly with Prosody end
iletre, the two subjecte on which 1010110011οο seems most
required by English studente 01 Ρ100100. I hope in time to
edit other pleys 01 this author and 1ο 10110 up one by one the
remaining topica 01 10101001, such 00 Ρ1001100 1100110000 end
Syntax, end the history 01 the Plautine Text in antiquity.

To Professor Skutsch 01 Β100100 University my best 11100110
are due for the help Ι have received from him 10 the prepare-

tion 01 this volume.
