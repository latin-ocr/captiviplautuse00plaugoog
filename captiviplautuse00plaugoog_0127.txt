iam sei avem coeperas, prohiberet apponi We have no good reason for
doubting thet seats were provided for the spectatore as early as Plautus’
time. In 194 nc. the frent pleoes were reserved for senators (For a
full discussion of the question, see Fabia in Reuss de Philoloyie, xxi.
pp. ll sqq. ; Marquardt end Mommsen, Rern„ Altertlrtmcr⁸ vn p. 481)

Various indicatione however of a postPlautine authorship are pointed
out in the notes to vv. 10, 19 (if we retain the reading of the MSS), 34, ⁴0,
49, 10, tt, 11. Their united evidence is strong enough to make a ‘prims
facie’ osse against the genuineness of the whole or tbe greater pert of our
prologus, especially since it does not contain any clear traces 01 Plautus'
genius. It has the appearance bere end there 01 haring been made out of
lines 01 the ‘internal prologue’ of the pisce, the opening monologue of
Ergasilus (see notes on vv. t, 24, 27-8), with the subsequent remarks
of Hegio (see note on v. ³4).

The ancient commentatore on Terence commend that poet for his skill
iu explaining to the audience the plot of e play in its opening scene. The
first scene of the Andria is praised for its thorougbly satisfactory explana
tion 01 the plot without the clumsy aid of a amative prologus or a ‘deus
ex machins' (Donat in Andr. 1. i. l 1000 eccene pro orysms' moon

by Terence himself in the prologus to the Adelphos, vv. 112-4ε

But it was not peculiar to Terence Plautus follows it in more then one

of the prologus to the flebammaa, vv. 16-17:
Sed dc argumento ue aspectet& sabulos,
Senes qai luc ment, irem uobis aperies.

In the Captivi the informetion required for the comprehension of the
piace is given in the opening scenos of the play by Ergasilus (vv. 92-101),
Hegio (vv. 110-1) end the two Captives (vv. 219 sqq), and it seems st first
sight as if the narrative in the prologus was superfluous. But there is one
piece 01 information necessary, if not for the comprehension, at least for

'- ²* the appreciation of the play, which could not be imparted 10 the audienoe
during the action 01 the pley itself‚ and thet is the relationship of one of the
Coptives to Hegio. It wes absolutely necessary that the audience should
know from the outset that Tyndarus wss Hegio's long-lost son; for other·
wise all the delicate irony 01 the situation in the soenes between Hegio and
Tyndarus would be lost upon them, nor could they help being puualed by
