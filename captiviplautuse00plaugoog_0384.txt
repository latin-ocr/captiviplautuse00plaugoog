aramma

and of the ordinary gronp, lem 79:

susploionem et cnlpam ut άὸ aa &gregat

where ob oe ia written in the best Palatina MS. apso, aa it would probably
be pronouneed A disyllabio Prepesition was aeoented on the final syllable
before an enolitio Pronoim an aocentnation very faithfully mileoted by the
incidenoe of ictus in Plautue’ lines, eg.

ltin. 619 dloisoaie et mni ut erqo te fni et sum, referas gretiam.
ob. 733 sine dote, quom eins rem peada oie habetm domi.
stica 415 et is hodie aptd nie oenat et frater mens

Before a Noun on the other hand opud is quite differently treated. ln the
phrase apud faroni, for example, Plautus scano apid fenam, and this word-
gronp shews thesemo incidenee of ictus aa afonreyllabled word of this
(Fourth Paeon) form (ξ 1), apzldsonan (Intr. ii 19).

21. The strong etrsss ol interrogative, and the weak etiess of Relative
and Indefinite Prononna, ia refleoted in the versification ol Plautus and
Terenee in their treatment of euch a word as ande. Il we examine the
instanoes of aaa& Relative and wido Intenngative in their playsl, we see
that in the great majority the Relative atanda in theri and the Interrogative
ia arei. Similarly qais Interrogative, a word which naturally stands at
the beginning of a sentence or line, will be found in this position far oftsnsr
in Troohaio lines, where the iotua falls on the first syllable, than in lambio,
where the iotns falls on the second syllable of the line The predominant
stress of the interrogative in the phinee qais lio tantors 1, ‘who’e thisl’
is eoboed by its normal ictus qais lio homost! (Seyffert, BerL Pla. Woet
1891,p. 108) Similarly the normal inoidenoe of ictus in qaid ital, qaid
aqisl, qaid dis (Skutsch in Berl. Pla Woole 1892, p. 1613) seems to iefleot
the pronunciation qaid-ital, qaid-affl, qutddi'ol A good example of the
treatment of interrogativas is Asin. ate:

Unde eumaml quem lntemortaml qud hllno eeloeem ednferaml '

It may be added that qnidam? takes normally the ictus on the first
syllable (instanoes in Richardson, de ‘dam' particulo, p. 14), and similarly
qaid est qaod...l‚ qaid latae lat quod...?, qaid lude est osred... seem to
be normal (exemplos in Dittmar, Studien zor lalandella Modsoelebre,
pp. 11 sqq.). The hypothetieal aeoentnation ol the postposited Relative,
aa in liniae qai primus, &a is reflected hy the common incidenoe of ictus
in sueh oases in Plautus and Terence (unless the prefixed word is specially

emphasized), ag.
Haut prol 43 nam ndno amede qai scribunt nil pararint seni,
Heo. prol. 12 noane qai exactas feei ut inueteriaoemnt
