Similarly the Romanae forms oi a word like ministeriam (Ital.
meatim, Fr. metiar, Chaucer's ‘mistery ²) point to a pronunciation
min-sterium, a still further reduction οι an earlier mirslsten'am. And
Cicero’s story (Dic. ii. 40. 84) of Crassus mistaking the cry oi a fig-
seller Cauneas! Gcaaecsl (sc. ficata cordo) for the warning cccc as
sos, shews that cdere* must have been pronounced adca, or rather cca
(ct aea and nece), and that the whole phrase must have been
uttered in some such way as cdo( )-c(c)-ece.

17. In the iace of all this evidence it is hard to see how the old
theory was ever accepted, that Plautiae scansione like cave (normal),
anemurium (occasional), were due to the ‘ictus of the verse’ and
had no existence outside of the metrical line¹l The explanation οι
the shortening is plain. In all languages with stress-accentuation the
syllable with weakest stress in a word or in a sentence is the
syllable which immediately follows or immediately precedes the
syllable with the strongest stress In Latin, if this unaccented
syllable consisted of a short vowel, its wealrening took the form of
Syncope; jartpc (Plaut) became jdryc, patrtgo (Plaut.) became
pdrqo: or change of quality 3 dbdpe (Gk. ἄπαγε) became first abege
(cf. abegit, MSS. οι Plaut. Cape. 814), then adipe. If it shewed
along vowel it did not suffer this change (Lat. [οπο. ch. iii. ἓ 30),
though it might ii the length was length by ‘position' merely,
eg. tolentwn for talantum (τάλαντον). When preceded by a short
syllable, the change it suffered was seduction oi its length, from a
long to a less long, a ‘half-long,' or even a short syllable. In the
sentence ‘ex Graecis bonis Latinas fecit non bonas' the strong
stress thrown on the accented (short) syllable oi the emphatic word
bonis had the effect oi making the second syllable sound as if it too
were a short syllable lilse the first, so that Terence allows ὂόιιῐε in

Iastin word hae le to some surprising attempta st scansion in Plautus, such as =
the attempt tc ecan cmlco ior amica in Stich. 700:

tbmica, utar utrubi decumbemus? lbi tu sane sdperior
(amica P, A ιι. l. Read atico, Imperat. οι usitare, sc. digitis),

erilis lor erilis in Aul. 599:

flirile imperium ediscat ut quod frons uelit ocull sciant
(stes.=1>; ert ille Wagner.)

It would, in tace, scarcely leave a single syllable saie which was preceded by s
short s llsble. Well may we characterize this type oi scansion bys line con-
stmctcd cn the same principles:
