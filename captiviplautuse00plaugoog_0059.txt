Syllaba Anceps ie found at the same place, see above, 5 33.) This
is not real Hiatus oi the kind referred to by Cicero. All that these
scansione imply ie that to Plautus these long lines were aa much

pairs of short lines as anything else, and that, e.g., nod. 388 might
be written:

Sed quid fletl Ego dicam tibi:

hoc sese excruciat animi,
just as we may write:

of all the days that's in the week
I dearly love hutone day ;

And that'e the day that comes between
The Saturday and Monday,

as four short or as two long lines.

Bitschl, however, in his opposition to the lax theory ol previous editors, that
Hiatus was admissible in any circumstances whatever in Plautus, set his lace
against even this Metrical Hiatus, so lar as he could. His riews were lor a time
accepted by his pupils, the editors oi the large Teubner edition sc that in their
earlier volumes the text hae been systematically altered in avoidancs ot a
supposed illegitimate hiatus of this kind. In the small Teubner emtion these
slterations heve been discarded. Some details regarding the extent to which
two closely connected words are allowed this Metrical Hiatus, eg. molestante,
will be round in Broelr, Qnacet. Gramm. 172.

Klots (Grundrlge, pp. 165 sqq, 208 sq.), although he rightly denies the
possibility el Plautus allowiug hiatus at the mere caesura os an lambio Senarius.
thinks that ancient editors oi Plautus allowed it, and that lines like Aul. 899:

congrum, muraenam Ι exossata lac sient (vl. c. m. exdorsua, quantum polest),

are ‘doctored’ lines, ol which he finds some 70 or 80 examples in Plautus
Seyffert (Berl. Pliil. Woclt. 1891, pp. 878 sqq.) has succeeded iu throwing strong
doubt on this theory.
