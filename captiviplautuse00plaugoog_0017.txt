Τὴθ other two minuscule MSS„ which contain the lest twelve
plays, are closely related to esch other. They are both direct copies
of one and the same original (1³⁰⁰), and that original itself a copy
of P, but by no means so faithful a copy as B. They are :-

6. (0) the Codex Decumates, now in the Palatine collection at
Heidelberg (abeli-mark Pol. Lot. 1613), but formerly in the Abbey
of Freising near Munich. It is written in minusculas of the eleventh
century and contains only the last twelve plays ; though the fact
that the first quaternion was originally marked xvii, the second xviii,
and so on, shews us that it was copied from en original which con-
tained all the plays. 0 hae 26 lines to the page,

7. (D) the Codex Ursinianus, in the Vatican Library (chelf-
mark Vct. lot. 3870), written in minusculas of the eleventh century.
It was this MS. whose discovery (in some pert oi Germany) at the
Rendssance caused so much enthusiasm among scholare, who now
ior the first time became acquainted with the last twelve plays ot
Plautus (Ritschl, Protagoram, xxxii.; Opaca. v. 296). All MSS. oi
Plautus written subsequent to its discovery reproduoe its textos these
plays in en edited form known as the ‘Itala recensio' (Bitschl, Pro
lagg. xlv. sqq. ; Oynasc. ii. l sqq.). D contains also some of the first
eight plays (see below). It hes, like 0, 26 lines to tbe pege ; and
this number has been assumed for 1²⁰⁰ on the strength partly of this
coincidence, partly of other indicatione.

8. of our manuscript authorities tor the first eight plays two
bave been already mentioned; B, containing all the eight, end D,
containing the first three and Capt. 1-503¹. But the relation oi
B to D in the first eight plays and for the last twelve is different.
For the last twelve B stands at a stege neurer to the archetype
than D, at the same stage ae the lost original (1³⁰⁰) oi D. But for
the first eight B and D seem to be ae closely related as (land D
ior the last twelve, both being immediate copies of one and the
