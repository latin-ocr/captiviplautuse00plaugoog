Dramatists‚ but excluded by tho Augustan poeta, many seem at first
sight to be archaiams rather than colloquialisms‚ because they aro
found in other early pocts. Disyllablc ῐοᾱηη, for example (ᾖ 15),
occurs in Lucilius (and in Lucretius too). But the truth ia that
the exclusion of colloquial forms and scansione from the language
cf elevated poetry was not fully accomplished till Augustus' time.
The earliest poeta took the language as they found it' and
applied to it the Greek laws of quantitative metra. A language
with a stressaccent like the Latin did not readily adjust itself
to the quantitative test. Many cf its syllables, as pronounced
in ordinary discourse, wera not definitely long nor definitely
short, but what modern phanaticians call ‘half-loog’ syllables.
Δ word like ctat, when pronounced separately and with due
regard to the spelling, would exhibit a second syllable long by
position, but in the conventional atteranoe of a sentence like aon
braye abest hoc ab illc the word would sound as like a pyrrich
aa an iambus. Ennius required stricter rules of pronunciation for
tbe language of elevated poetry than previous poets; and his
strictness was maintained and increascd by his poetical successore.
But it took considerable time before poetical diction attained the
severe regularity that it shows in the hands of the Augustan poets.
Lucilius allows himself to acan attat (ix. 29 M.) :

‘r' non multum abest hoc cacosyntheton atque canina
si lingua dicas ‘nihil ad me,’

though Ennius in his Epic restricta this shortening to final vowels,
eg. pust, to the complete (or almost complete) exclusion of, ag. tepent,
and was followed in this restrictiori by his successors (cf. g 18).

But it would be a mistake to regard abest, pust as pronunciatione
characteristic of Plautus' time like curat, terret, audit, dixit. In
ordinary discourse the words would be so pronounced in the time of

virgil as in the time of Plautus ; but while Plautus admits these
pronunciatione of everyday life into his verse, Virgil and the
Augustan poeta exclude them. Though, however, they were ex-
cluded from elevated poetry, they were still allowed in Dramatic
composition. Afranius, who belongs to the close of the Republioan
period, admits them as freely as Plautus.

by virgil and poeta cf his class, are:
