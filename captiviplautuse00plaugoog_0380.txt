end ecceut in Plautus’ linea And yet it surely stands tc resson that Latin,
like other languages, would have its enclitic words, its auridary verbalis

emphatic and unemphatic pronouns, its subordinate words in certein word-
groups, end that in a spoken sentence each and every word would net have
meted out to it the full measure of acuent which would be assigned ιο it
when pronounced apert In the phrase cclc scire the verb colo ise mere
curiliary, which rasigns its eoeent in favour oi the important word of the
phrase, scire. In voluptas meo the Possessive Pronoun ie an enclitic
appendage oi the Noun, end the compound word voluptas-mea ie by the
ordinary law oi Latin Accentuation accented 011 the antepenultimate,

great many more will inevitably be discovered as time goes on. It is now
coming ιο be recognized as the duty oi an editor oi Plautus to confirm the
mention or retention oi a current phrase in this or thet line by an appeal, not

merelyto the arrangement oi the words, but also to the incideres olicias, in the
other occurrences oi the phrase throughout the plays. The emendation aum

quoe eat cauea ior aum guae ccccc ect oi the MSS. in the line (Aul. teat:

can be confidently rejected beccum it departs irum the invarieble order ol the
words in all other occurrencea oi the phrase in Plautus. We may almost as
conlidently reject eny emendation which wonld involve a metricel ictus like

lt. The existence of a secondary accent along with the main secent
rurist be considered in a discussion of Sentencehocentuation as well aa
oi word-Accentuation. Just as a long word like tempestate could not be
pronounced without e perceptible minor accent on the first syllable aa well
as the main necent on the paenultima, so a long word-group like jusjudic-
dam must have had a secondery accent on jus The latin Grammarians,
as we have seen, scarcely ever allude ιο this secondary eccent, whether in
single words or in word-groups. They tell us, ior example, that unde, the
Relatin was an enclitic or subordinate word in the Latin sentence, in
contrast ιο the aoeented interrogative mide But they do not edd, what
the analogy of other languages would lead us io expect, that in collocatione
like vaddemirum, aad(e)cdo6ni a secondary secent fell on the Relative
They erc es silent about this secondary acccnt that must surely have
accrued in such collocatione to subordinate words, as they ere about the

secundary accent in long words like temputdtc and in word-groups like
