6 mrsonucrros.

10. Two other MSS. come from an original (PB), which was
itseli a copy of PBD, so that their evidence is of little orno velue
against the united testimony oi B and Ι), They aro :—

(E) in the Ambrosian Library, Milan (J 257 ins), saec. xii. ult.

Part of the Aulularia (vv. 192-605) has been added hya ltth cent
corrector¹ hom the ‘Itala recensio!

(V) in the Univeraity Library‚ Leyden ( Voss. lat. 4⁰. 30), saec.
xii in. It has lost Amph, Asia, Aul. 1-189, Epio. 245-fia.

ll. Certain corrections (V') in the heyden MS. come from an
inferior ‘doctored' text of PE (see aaa. Rev. a 319) which was
tho original of the two MSS. that romain to be mentioned :-

(J) in the British Muscam (Περ. 15 0. xi), saec. xii. in, a MS.
somowhat damaged by fire.

It contains a‘subscriptio‚’ which seems tc have been copied from the
original ‘doctored' text:

Exemplar mendum tandem me compulit ipsum
Cunctantem nimium Plautum exemplarier istum.

Ne grsspicus (leq. graphione) mendis proprias idiota repertis
Adderet et liber hic falso patre falsior esset
(0) in the Ottobonian collection at the Vatican (ottob. Misc. lat.

687), saec. xi, a mere fragment containing Capi. 400-555.

This ‘doctored' text ot the first eight plays is practically useless.
The ‘Itala recensio,' based in the last twelve plays upon D, seems
in the earlier plays to have been based on a MS. that exhibited this
‘doctored' text. All Renaissance MSS. oi Plautus are therefore
of no valae whatsoever as evidence for the text of Plautus, whether
in the first eight or in the last twelve plays. Where they diverge
irom the P-text their reading is due either to a corruption in their
original or to conjectural emendation by their editor. A collation
oi one MS. of this kind (F, a Leipzig MS.) will be found in the
Critical Apparatus of the large Teubner edition of Plautus, a
collation of parts oi another, the Codex Burneianus at the British

Muscam (Bam 228) in the Appendix to my Codex Tur-nebi os
Plautus.

12. Al] these extant minuscule Mss. and ¹1¹, a lost minuscule
MS„ we have found to be descendants of a common archetype Pi,

¹ The corrections by this hand are ignored in my critical notos, as are the
corrections by &nmmos hands in the other MSS.
