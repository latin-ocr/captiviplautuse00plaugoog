tribrachwords aud word-endings, and the almost complete avoidance¹ of
the same in dactylwords and wordendinge, eg. peccora, disperdere. 'l'hese
lawe, imposed on the Greek Dramatic Matres as soon as they were trans-
planted ιο Roman soil, reveal unmistakably the existence of an accentual,
beside the quantitative clement, in early Latin dramatic poeti-5². To what
extent does this accentual clement essert itself l

6. As regards the accentuation of the single word (word-accent as
opposed to sentence-accent) we find a wonderful amount of agreement
between ictus and accent in the lines of Plautus His greatest difficulty
must, of course, have been with iambus-words like sero, secat, and it must

ha've been increased by the large number of long final syllables in the
language at his time, ag. feror, serat (see lntr. ii. ξ 1). The Latin Aoecnt,
as we have seen (ξ l), is excluded from the final syllable, so that the word-
aocent was fero, jeram, feror, ferat. But the nature of ιιο Iambic and
Trochaic matres allows no opportunity for the ictus ιο sall on a short
syllable immediately followed by a long syllable. The permissible ictus·
forms in au Iambic line are (1) Iambus Α, (2) Spondeo -λ, (3) Tribrach
νύν, (4) Anapsest Μ, (ι) Dactyl -c.‚ (6) Prooelcusmatic w⁴⁹3 in a
'l'rochaic (1) Trochee ἐν, (2) Spondee Α, (3) Tribrach ⁴⁹2, (4) Anapaest

cum quantitatis severitate summam accentus observationem, quoad eius fieri
posset, conciliatam esseben never been successfully impugned. Proi. W.
Meyer, in a long article in the Proceedinpr cs the Bcccrioa Acoderry ior less,
has stated perhaps as powerful a case as can he stated against it. His main
argumentis that such coincidence as there is ol accent and ictus in Plautus ιι
really due to the law oi Latin Accentuation, which requires every long penulti-
mate syllable ιο ιο accented; the metrical ictus ialls normally on long syllables
in the line, and where these long syllables huppen ιο ιο penultimate syllables,
the ictus must coincide with the secent. There are thus, he says, more chauces
oi the ictus and accent lighting on the same syllable in Latin than in Greek
poetry, and this, and this only, is the reason oi the coincidences ιο which
Ritsohl has drawn attention in Plautus. rhen he proceeds to malie a minute
investigation into the technique oi Plautus’ versification‚ especially his treat-
ment οι the trochaic and iamhic caesura, with the object of shewing that the
avoidance oi this and thet form oi caesura would compel the choice at certain
parts oi thelina oi such words as would necessarily have the ictus on the same
syllable as the accent. These details oi techniquc have been challenged by
Prot. Langen in the Plrilolopua, vol. xlvi, who also supplies us with a striking
refutation oi Meyer's main argument. He himself, he tells us, once made the
experimant os applying tha Latin accentual lawe ιο ιιο trimeters of Aristophanes,
but lound that the coincidence ol acceut and ictus was not at all so frequent as
itis in the Senarii of Plautus and Terence, a faa which plamly indicates some
other influence to be at work in the latter.
