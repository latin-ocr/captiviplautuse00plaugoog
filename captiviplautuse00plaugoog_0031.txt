But -ᾱ in Nom. sing. of 1 Deel. and Nom. Δοο. Plur. of Neuter Nonne is
unknown to Plautus and Terenoe„even in loen-words from the Greek, so that
the seansions familie (Trin. 251)‚epistal‹i (Asin. 762), libera (lepidam of. ς 34),
and even Samio (Eun. 107), Sosio (Amph. 439), must he abandoned. In the
Vooative of Greek Names like Sosiae. Leonides the long a seems to he found, eg.
Leonida (Asin. 740), if the reading oi the Mes. he eorreet. ln the Abl. Βίης. of
the 3 Deol., where a long final vowel is required hythe metra, we should change
-a ol the Mes. to -i ς for -ἕ and i appear to have been the ablativo forme in uae
in Plautus· time, never e. The few apparent exemplos of -ὀ in the Infinitive
(Lat. Lsay. viii. 5 85) are probably illusory (see 534). The ebt Plur. in -Μι,
apparently offered by the Mes. in some passages (ef. 5 34), ia oertainly impossible.
In the Firet Deol. the ending -aa is not found in the Nom. Plur. (in Tria. 5³9
altentoe Λᾶν. or alternis Adv. should be read) nor (with the exeeption of the
legal form familiar in the phrases poter samaias, do.) in the Gen. sing. The
old Gen. Βίης. ending -ᾶῑ is found along with its olaeaieal shortened form -ae,
Notioe that aa Gen. is perhaps never alided‚ while elision of -oe Dat, -οι Nom,
Plur. (and -ae Loo. Sing.) is frequent (Leo Plorat. Ferret 3123 oritieised by
Skutsch in Jahreaber. Roma. Philol. iv. 84). (For details on these audinga see
Lot. Loay. eh. vi.)

6. vowel preceding vowel in same word. That a long
vowel or diphthong before another vowel tended to be shortened
in Latin we sse from forms like protendo for prae-hendo, deam
for demo. How far the forms sanctioned by the Augustan
poete tallied with those of current pronunciation and with those
admitted into the earlier poetry,is not easy to discover. Servius
(ad Virg. Aea. i. 451) says that audiit, aare were the forms of

current usage. Quintilian (1. v. 18) declares aairaa to be the only
form of the (lenitire in aetual use (‘unlue'...extra carmen non
deprendas). The scansione illias, istius ho. are usually denied for
Plautus, although his usual practice with originally long vowels that
preoede other vowels seems to be to admit both the long and the
short quantity (but only platea, balineae, ho).

In Plautus we find occasionally such scansione ae:

(a) -e‘, -ῑοτο, eg. iero (lapt. 194 (q. w), ierant Ad. 27, aud'taraa
Phorm. 573, audeat-it Hee. 813. ieram is attested by Donatus in his
note on Terenoe Ad 27 (1. i. 2): producte i pronuntiando, quod uos
addita v ‘iverant ' dicimus.

. (ὁ) -ᾱί in the Per-feet ol Verbs in «rao, eg. institui Most. 86,
’ perstitit Most. 164, pluerat Men. 63, fait Pers. 168, stliase Bacch. ὅ.

The statement of C. F. Miiller (Nachtrllye, p. 84) that fui, fait are only
allowed at the end of the line or hemistieh, is ineerreol (aee Seyllert in Berllner
Philoloyiache Wochemohn'st, xviii. 1557). Adiriero(01 adirlro, Lat. May. viii.
48) for adtrivere (ef. Most. 691) oeeure in Phor-m. 537:

fleri miserum, qul me dudum, ut dixti, adiuerit obmiter,
