Dimeter catalectic (princeps ia Amoris vica), whereas to Aristo
phanes v. 299 oi the Lysistrota was en Iambic Tetrameteerataleotic
with ‘syncope’ of the first thesis of the third ‘metrum’ (τοοῦτο πάσῃ
μηχανῶ·

That curione ‘Anaolasis' oi Iambic matre, whereby a choriambus
(- υ υ -) tahas the place oi an lambio metrum (ς, - o -), which
appears in the Greek choruses (and on special occasions even in
dialoguepaesagee, eg. ΠαρθενοπαῖΙος and φαιοχίτωΙνες), was probably
not practised by Plautus. (On its use in Greek see Wilamowita
Here. Fur. ii. p. 190.)

Nor have we reason to think that Plautus allowed a pieoe of
prose to break the continuity oi his verse, as Aristophanes did, eg.
Bq. 941 εὖ γε νὴ τὸν Δία καὶ τὸν Ἀπόλλω καὶ τὴν Δήμητρα.

But the Epiphonema, i.e. extrametrical Intery'ection or addreea‚
eg. Nulo. init:

ua lob,
ὦ Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ, τὸ χρῆμα τῶν νυκτῶν ὅσον,
ia familiar to Plautus, eg. Coa. 619:
attat,
quid illdc clamoris, obsecro, in nostrast domol

(Gi Epid. 181, Ter. Phorm. 485. Mar. Vict 85 attests thie usage.)

eomc would find a syncopated lambio Ootonarins in Gar. 168: nam ubi domi
etia earn soptr manua obluitur (usually scanned aa a Oratio Tetrameter); a
syncopatad Troohaio Trimeter Gataleotio in Cos. 731: Δ. dt ego opinor nisi
resistis. Β. ‘n Ζεῦ (probably an Ionio Trimeter); a syncopated lambio
septenarius in Cure. 102: nam nbi td profusu's, ibi egb me pernelim aepdltam3

sn lambio octonarius with one 'anaolaatio' metrum in Tria. 24‘1: ibi illa
pendentem terim i(am) amplius orat3 nbn satis. (On the ¹ choriambo-[ambios’
ο1 Ter. Aa. rr. iv. saofi 46.)

The question how iar strophio arrangement oan be found in Plautus’ Cantica
indisouessd by Klotz, Grandrilpe, p. θοός oi. Leo, Pico. Cant.. p. 77.

5. The Colometry (in unecientific language‚ the arrangement in
lines) of Plautue' Cantica, an arrangement which has been referred
with some probability to the end of the second century ao. (Leo,
Plorat Garat. 6), is not always easy to determine. The two ancient
recensione oi the text which are represented by our two families oi
MSS. (i. 5 17) seem occasionally to have differed in this point. Thus
Pseud. 1329-30 appear in the ‘Ambrosian' recension es a long
Baoohiac series :

A. Quid minoi numquid iratus es aut milri aiit filio prop
ter has rea, Simol B. Nil proiecto.
