17—19] PROLOGVS. 123

Fugitiuus ille, ut dixeram ante, huius petri
Domo quem profugiens dominum abstulerat uendidit
Is postquam hunc emit, dedit eum huic gnato suo

18. profugiens B’VKJ ε profugens 1³¹1> abstulerit Β), corr. θ’ ct vid.

17. Dixerem. The Pluperiect Ind oi eum is frequently used for the
Periect in colloquial Letin (eg. v. 305); but probably not the Pluperiect
of other Verbs. We must teke the Tense here to imply ‘I hed said, prior
to the disturbcnce which caused my digression' (cf. ed v. 938). In the
Manduria (820-1) the expression emptisuerant, ‘they were bought‚’ that
inlls from the lips of Simo, is seized upon bytho cunning slsve Tranio cs e

mesnsof making his mester Theoproprides believe that Simohns again sold
the house which hebed purchased:

Tu. Non uideor uidisse postis pulcriores. Sr. Pol mihi
Eo pretio empti fuerant olim. Tu. Audin ‘fuerent’ diceret

This use eisdem ior sru' wes the beginning of thot tendency to substitute
the Pluperiect ior the Perfect which we see in Lete Letin end which is
reflected in the Romence Langueges, eg. Old French wilm, ‘he saw!
(For s fuller sccount see Blese, certene des Plusqwmpesektc Giessen‚
lese) On the scansion licius patri see note on v. 4.

18. 'l'he reading of the original (P'1') of our MSS, profugam, cen be
ro easily explained by the practice of writing pand i in ligature in early
minuscule thet it would be unwise to reject the correction supplied in
other MSS, prostylon. It mcy however be mentioned thet in the only
instance of the Adj. prositque in Plautus, ltin 701 Effupr'cu ex urbe irtam),
profugus puenhm demas, our MSS. offer the unmetrical proscyime, which
editors suppose to heve been s gloss written above profugus in some ecrly

archetype (cf. profugus: prosuprcnc Loewe, Gloriae Nominum, p, 205).
Since the traces of the Acrist Tense in Plautus cre limited to ‘Aerist’
subjunctivus like evenat (Pres. eveniat), attigas (Pres. attingus), which ere
few in number end of restricted usage, it would be hamrdous to edd to
them u supposed ‘Aorist' participle, proseqens (cf. class. Lat. parens,
Pres pomp though it must be allowed thet the normal rhythm
would be secured ior this line by reediug Domo quem proyirym (or pro-
fugcc); see note on v. 111. Dominum, ‘his young mester‚' fitium

19.·- Is. The use oi' liic in the sense or rir(the Pronoun thet indicates
epereon or thing elreudy mentioned) is not unknown in a later ege ; end
