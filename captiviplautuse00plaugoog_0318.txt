826. Oonmeatus. Ol Mil. 224 Qua cibatus cmnuwatmque ad te et
leym tuas Tuto poscit permira. (libne. Priscian takes this for a
Fourth Decl Gen sing, instead of Nom. Sing. with nentri commeatus meo
in apposition The same doubt attaches to lectm in Amph, 513:

Prius abis quam lectus ubi cubuisti concaluit locus,

where Priscian makes the word a Fourth Decl Gen Sing. gevemed by
locum though it may equally be Nom. Sing. with ubi masiti ἰοαω in
apposition. In view of the narrow limite of the Fourth Deciension in
Plautus (see note on v. 855), I hesitate to accept Priscian’s explanation.
For the inverted order os the sentence cf. Mil. 1043 deus diynior scit quie
queam lonso qui esset? Brir suggests punctuation after adar, the Verb to
be understood as repeated after utus.

827. Hunc Hegionem...senem For the order cf. ad v. 875, and for
the sense of hunc, ad y. 7. In Aul. 171 we have:

Nostin hunc senem Euclionem ex proxumo pauperculum?

There is no need to make this and similar phrases with cesso Interrogative
Sentences.

828. The defect in the line is likely to have been caused by the loss
(through Hoplography) of the word locro in some form Leo accepts
camerarius insertion of lominum ester bomine. But the Plautine phrase
is uento lonso, not mmo lominum (Ter. Eun 757). (On the Hiatus after
bomo see Introd ii. 5 40.) The form qui presente a difficulty, ior this Abl
(or Instrumental) is normally used as a Pronoun rather than a Pronominal
Adjective, and in no other line does it play the part of an Abl after a
Comparative For all that, to change the ‘lectio difficilior' of the MSS.
qai honum into quo lamine is of doubtful expediency. The use of qai
(Interrog. Pron.) ce Abl. Abs. in Bacch. 335, Sed qui premente id aarum
mama detersti, is similarly an isolated example Such lines as eas.
