Act V. Scene i. Hegio appears on the stage hythe righthand
door, having just returned from the harbour. He 11 accompanied by
Philocrates and by Philopolemus, his son, who had been captmed by the
Eleans and who hae been released through Philocratss' agency. Stalagmus,
the slave who kidnapped Tyndarus, follows in the rear, fattered with a boia
(v. 888). After Hegio'e opening song of thanksglving (in Bacchiac Tetra
metere, the earne metra 11 the mournful ‘canticum’ of Act 11. Sc. 11), the
metra is 'lhooheic septenarii. The courteey of Philopolemus in the service
of his newly acquir-ed friend, Philocrates, and the sollicitudo of the latter
on account of hie faithful slave, are cleverly depicted Tyndams ie
finally sent for, end the two go into the house, leaving Hegio to examine
Stalagmus

921 Redducem. Though redduco isa common Early latin form of
the Varh, the form reddata of the Noun 11 open to doubt (cf. reducem
v. 9³1). Plautus however uses it again in another Baochiac Canticum, in
the Badara (1. 909);

Quom 111 11 suis locis pulchre ornatum expediuit,
Templis redducam, plurima praeda onustum.

Similarly recolaait (1. 918 above), rellatum (Ter. Plena. 21 Qrtod ab illo
odlamrrut, siti 1111 rellatum putet) are abnormal forms (Introd ii. ξ o).
We have reduc in the two occmranoes of the word in Terence (Haut. 398,
Hac. 852), as, to all appearance, in ite single occurrence 11 the fragments
oi the other Republican Dramatiste (Naev. Troy. preat 2 R. Vita imcpalta
lacem ia pataviam reduc); so that many editore would banish it entirely
from Plautus also. Brix points out that tha Oblique Casa of the Personal
Pronoun normally follows the Possessive (ag. vv. 181, 400, 853, hc.) and

transposes 911111 reducem tuo te p. r. And yet it ie in Cantica that the
normal order is most liable to be departed from, and that abnormal forms
of words are most to be expected.
