postquam is generally accompanied by the same Tenes in the main clause,

ending in ea or in e long vowel is most frequent in Latin poctry when
eccompenied by a short syllable, eg. qai omont Virg, but we have in
Plautus eleo scansione like ds hordeo (with e unelided) Ario. 706, marn faro

not follow the rules of Sequence of Tenses so strictly as Cicero3 and in
