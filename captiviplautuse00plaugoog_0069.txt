III. METRE.

Relation to Greek Models.

l. To understand Plautine Metro we must regard it aa the
last stage in the development oi Greek Dramatic Matre Its
differences irom its model are ior the most part cases of progression
along the same line as was followed on Greek soil, though some are
due ιο a divergence on Latin soil, caused by the different character
oi the Latin and Greek langnages. The iree admission oi trisyllabic
ieet (5 7) into the Iambic and Trochaic lines oi Plautus, aa eom·
pared with those oi Aeschylus and Sophocles, is merely a continuation
oi the course taken by the Greek Comedians themselves ; the removal
of the restrictione oi this or that Matre to the expression oi this or
that feeling (5 4), and the etichic use (ie the use in continuone
passages) oi some metres (eg. Bacchiae, 5 26, versus Reiziani, 5 49)
which were originally employed merely as occasional variatione—all
this marks the last stage reached in the development oi Greek
Matre, a stage reached probably by the Alexandrian Dramatic
writers. On the other hand, the great regard paid ιο the natural
secent of words is something quite alien to Attic poetry, and is a
result oi the transierence oi Greek Metre to a country where the
accent was an accent oi stress and not an aceent oi pitch ertone,
like the Greek (Lat. [οπο. iii. 51). The complete avoidauce of such
an incidence of ictus as trahere, retrahere, detrahere, and the partial
avoidance of perdere, disperdere is due to the harsh effect produced
by the clash oi the natural accentuation, trithei-c, perdere with such
an ictus (see Appendix).

2. The Roman Tragedians found models for cantica in the
choruses oi their Greek originale. Thus Ennius’ Anapaests in the
opening canticum oi his Iphigenia are a reproduction oi those of
Euripides (quoted in 5 21) 3 though we cannot suppose the Bacchiae
passage in his Thyestea (vv, sos-6 R.) to have had any parallel in a
Greek Drama oi the fifth or even fourth century (5 26). But Plautus
cannot have been indebted for his cantica to Menander or any other
poet oi the New Comedy. The chorus, with its strophio and anti-
