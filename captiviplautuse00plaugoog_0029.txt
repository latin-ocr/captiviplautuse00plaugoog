Leo's theory that flnal r may be elidad (like final m) belone an initial vowel
is supported by strong arguments (Plout. Formh. pp. 224 eqo). The spelling
·eet ior -la est, eg. qualest ior qualia eat, similest ior similis eet, is one pieoe oi
evidence adduoed hy him. But the theory seems ιο he onlilrely on ‘l priori’
grounds and to have no certain instances in the lines ol Plautus to vindicate
it (sse Maurenbrecher p. 98). On sactum lor factm ert, deo, see below, 9 12.

Similarly in words or word-groops like saumae (somn), priusquam (prius
quom) do, we find the short scansione conda (5 1), pmtsquom (seldom prista-
qmm, with second syllable long by position), eg. Ena. Troy. 239 R. (in a prayer) :

inspice hoo laciniis pririsqoam flet: prohibessls soalon
a scansion like nimieque is not found (heo, Plout. Forecl. p. 268).
The incidence of ictus on the syllable is quite consistent with the

short scansion (ᾗ 29), eg. dictale Prometheus in an anapaestic line oi
Accius (Troy. 534 R.). So scan Amph. 903 mimia westenda ee.

4. -ulus and ·lus, -ulum and ·lum have somewhat different
usage in the literar-y language oi Plautus' and of Virgil's time.
When a vowel originally preceded l in these terminatione, Plautus
does not allow the syncopated iorm. The Diminutive Suffix -oulo
(originally co-lo-), ior example, never appears as -clo in his lines : eg.
meleulum, not ‘ mellicium,’ in Cos. 837 ; osculi, not ‘oscli,’ in Stieis. 91.
When the vowel is a later insertion, to facilitate pronunciation, this
extended iorm is not as readily allowed astho older form which
lacked the parasitis vowel: eg. velliclum (originally -clom, from
-tlom; cf. Gk. ἅν-τλον, ἐχέ-τλη) is invariable, never valliculam 3
peremtum, dic, where a long syllable precedes the termination olom

(dmm), is allowed only (but ci. Pera. 524, liud. 169) οι the end oi
a line, ie. through metrical necessity:

Oopt. 740 periclum vitae meae tuo stat periculo.

We most therefore read passerculum (with Diminotive suffit eolo-l in Aria.
666; meleretum (with Dim. suffix) in Cure. 11; usos-culo (with Dim. suffia) in
(loe. llll3 oraclo (with soffix -tlo-) in lien. 8413 tabernaclum (with ·tlo-) in
Amph. 4283 celorla (celric-hil in lllil. 1006; circos, not ‘circlis' (circvlo) in
locius Troy. 100 R.; mundulos, not ‘muodloe' in Truc. 658. (For infler details
see Classical Reuiero, vi. 87.) Plautus uses the older form popius (oi. Poplicola)
ss well as the ohssimr populus, ag. Pseud. 126, sciet. 490-2.

See Studemund (in Fleckeisen’sJahrbilclrercxiii. 64) ior exemplos oi extempulo
at the end oi the line in Plautus. ‘Hercule' (Asin. 275, διο), ‘exempulum‘
(min. 389) are doubtful.

5. Other ‘early’ forms. merrd, marro were the Adverbs
in use in the time of Plautus ς frustra, contro (altered to the type oi
extra, supro ael, in the Augustan age (for details see Wolfflin in
Arellio Lat, Maikopr. ii 1); just as collus, odeleus were the Plautine,
sollum, vacuus the Augustan forms. Beside adcor (adoro-,2 Decl.)
