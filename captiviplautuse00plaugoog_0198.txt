question is addressed 101110 guarda, who, at the orders given by the
loratino just before his departure (vv. 213, alo), had retired 10 0 (11010000
from the Captivos Quos ante aedis lussl huc produci foras. On
these words has been based the theory that the Captivos after the Prologus
were not seen on the stage until Act 11. Sc i. It is surely much more
natural to suppose the Captives 10 have remained on the stage from the
beginning of the play; and there are many indicatione that this was
actually the 0000 (000 noles on vv. 98, 1. ii. init, 110, iao, 169, 11. i. init).
Hegio's remark here need not refer 10 00100 order subsequent 10 that given
in vv. 114-5. He may be speaking merely of the instructions which 010
supposed 10 have been issued prior 10 the play, and in complianoe with
which the Captivos appear on the stage during the Prologue
