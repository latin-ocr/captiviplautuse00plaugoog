l. 'l'he Law ol latin Acoentuation (known ae the ‘Paenultima Law')
isa very simple one, namely, that the acoent falls on the antepenultimate
syllable, if the paenultima be short; on the paenultima itself‚ if long, eg.
deora, decbrea 'lhe acoent never falls on the final syllable, except in the
case of syncopated or apocopated words like abta for abicit, loram for
loram). But there are traces in Latin, as Corssen proved, of au older
Aooentuatiom by which the acoent fell on the first syllable of every word
Oases of Synoope like qaindecim for quinquedecem, and of Vowel-mduction
like maiam from tri· (tres) and anam, concido (coneeido) from cam aud
caedo (caldo), point unmietakably ιο an early qatcequedeeem, manmena, οόιι-
cos'do, &c At what precise period the change, no doubt a gradiva] one, from
this older Aooentuation to the paenultima law began and completed itself,
it is difficult ιο ascertain But there is some evidence that it was still
incompleta in one particular in the period of the Early Drama, lor words
(or endings of words) of the metrioal form νυνὶ seem at that period to
have been still acoented on the first and not on the antepenultimate
syllable 'ihus balineae (the Plautina form), pieriae, &e seem ιο have
had in Plautus’ time the accentuation balimae, mabilia which explains
their subsequent reduction ιο belm, puerile (cf. Hor. actos noa alio rege

accented on the first syllable about 250 sc.. for the change oi unaooented

from the old ιο the olassioal accentuation, when, lor example, septenae
became sapietiae, tempestatibus became imperialibus, we can guess, partly
from the aualogy of other languagee, partly from the inherent probabilities
of the case, what the nature of that change was A long word like saphatia,
