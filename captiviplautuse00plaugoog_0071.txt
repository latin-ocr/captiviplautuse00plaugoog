from the choric strophes snd antistrophes ci Aristophanes is not
wholly satisfactory. Resides, certain features oi Plautus' Centies are
unlike anything in Aristophanes ; for instance, the combination oi
certain matres in the same canticum, and especially the stichic use oi
some metres which are employed only as an occasional variety hythe
Greek Comedian (3 l). Monodies make their appearance in the closing
period oi the Old Drsms, s famous instance being the song oi the
Phrygian slave in the Orestes (vv. 1369-1502) with its novel
combinaticn oi sll kinds oi metres; and in this point, as in so
many others, Euripides appears as the founder oi the later Dramatic
school. How iar the Middle Oomedy differed irom the Old in this
respect we do not know. At Alexandria the Monody was much
cultivated. The legitimate drama hed been succeeded by what might
be cellcd Music Hell songs (psychica, ihcppdisc, etc), whose singers
wore the dress and acted the part oi tho personage depictcd in the
verses.

The pretty little song recently discovered in Egypt¹ is apparently
one oi these; ior its stichic use oi Dochmii cannot be satisfac·
torily paralleled from the Attio Drama. Twenty successive lines (vv.
24-43) ere Dochmiac Monometers ε Μέλλω μαίνεσθαι, ΙΙ Ζῆλος γάρ μ’
ἔχει, etc.

Proi. Ieo² has accordingly proposed the very plausible theory
that Plautus icund his models for his Cantica in the contemporary

Hellenistic μαγῳδίαι cr ἱλαρῳδίαι, which were much in vogue at
Tarentum and other parts oi Magna Graecia, and doubtless in
Rome itself. It istc these thet he would look ior the immediate
models ior Plautus' stichic use oi the Bacchisc metra (fi 26), the
Versus Reizisni (5 49), end for all the new types which occur in
the Roman dramatists.

Aoompnrison by Aulus Gellius (ιι. xxiii.) oi a passage oi Caecilius with the
original passage of Menander. gives ns an interesting example oi the wey in
which s Roman comedim, for the sake of variety, substituted s lyris-passage or
song lor the dialogus-passage ol his original. Menander's lines are Iambic
Trimeters:

μέλλει καθευδήσω. κατείργασται μέγα
