11. PROSODY.

There is clearly 0000000100 between ccidi and cadi in Beceb. 100 :
Quin tu andi. Immo ingenium edidi haud pernoram hispide,
(ol. Gelonus xi. 1 1100000), 000 10 is not the 0 which is suppressed but the
following letter (oi. audeo, older ‹ividec llud. 538, ‘to have a mind ior‚' then ‘to
dare,' from 000100). 01. nauta (Mil. 1430) beside ηᾶυίεα (Men. 226). Full
(1000110 regarding the shortened iorm 01 the V·Perieot are given by Engelbreoht
in Wiener Studien vi.; Broek‚ Queat. Gramm. ii. The contractiori 01 -ivi-is
100 commoneat, ag. perit, ecit, abit (app. 5 8)‚pert (cf. (1.1. L. iv. 0001 perci,
a disyll.), 100. But -riuit probably did not 00001001. So not eg. ‘amat' (01.
Lacr. i. 70; vi. 587) lor amovit, ‘wasmont’ (wrongly read in Asin. 501 by
beo): -dmar ior 0010000 is lese objectionsble, eg. enarramus kd. 065 ; 01. 0. Lat.

000000. 'l'het a contracted iorm like peri may elide its final vowel is 000 certain,
eg. 11000051.

10. Mantuanis 01 r. Phyrgic is apparently allowed by
Plautus in Aac. 508:

Stat 11110, phyrgio, adriiex, lanarius,
though in 011 other passages the form used is phrygio. On the
other hand mvpeeedo is perhaps the only 1000 used, since tropeeeitu

seems never to bc really required by the metro (in apid. 143 we
should probably read qao a icrpeeaito).

Other probable examples are antio (Poen. 778) ior rdvio (where however the
allitcration favours racio), 0000001000 (Mil. 1000) ior percolens, corcotarim (Aul.
521) ior crocotariue.

11. Popular forms oi’ some Greek words. certain loan-
words from the Greek which were in everyday use are admitted by
Plautus in what we may call their ‘plebeian' or unliterary form.
An uneduoated Roman in pronouncing a Greek word put strese-
accent 00 000 same syllable 00 which the Greek accent (1.0. pitoh-
aocent) rested, without concerning himself about maintaining the
proper quantitative pronunciaticn 01 000 syllables. Greek εἴδωλον
became 1001000, Σοφία became Sosim abgam (ἄβυσσος) 'is in
Christian (popular) poetry scanned as a tribrach. This change
01 quantity is rigorcusly debarred by Augustan poeta except in
words 10 which it had established itseli too strongly to be removed,
eg. ‹irredra (ἅγκῦρα). Another ‘plebeiau’ pronunciation 01 Greek
gave to Greek χ a seond, whose precise naturaie matter 01 doubt,
but which had the 01100001 lengthening by position the preceding
vowel One mispronunciation 01 0010 kind which firmly established
itaell in latin is bracehium for Gk. βρᾶχῐον, lit. ‘the shorier part 01
000 arm' (irom the sboulder tc the elbow). In Plautus we see these
mieprouunoiations tolerated in such words as had become part and
parcel 01 000 common language‚ while in all others tbe ‘literary'
