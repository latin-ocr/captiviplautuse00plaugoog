ΤΗΒ ΡΙιΔΥ.

Nothing ia known of the origin ol the Copiola Comedy pronounced
by the youthful enthmiesm ol Lessing ιο be ‘the fineet pisce ever put
upon the atage¹.’ And yet our curiosity is strongly slirred by the singular
features of thia drama, which claime a place for itaelf apart from and
above all the other dromas of the New or Middle Oomedy that are known
to ua (lan it have been the one mammio venture ol some cultured
Athenian, who in a happy moment conceived the idea of purilying and
spiritualiaing the etock charactera and incidente ol the Comedy of hie
timei Or iolla isolation due merely to the losa of all the other productione
ol its authori 'l'he tyrannical father, cutwitted by intrigue (comicus etalem
nnec), ie hera replaced by a wonderfully attractive type of the γέρων
εὔκολος, as fullos ‘bonhomie' aa Periplectomenus in the Miles Gloriam,
but oi lar greater depth ol character and width of sympathy, who reproves
more in sorrow than in anger, and never for amoment loses our siccem
respect and hearty good-will ln Philocrates and Philopolemus we
have an agreeable change from the hackneyed type of profligate son
(amam ephotar), aellishly intent on hia own vicione or, at best, thoughtlese
schemam while the cunning slave (emulor callidae) receives a veritable
apotheosis in the part ol* Tyndarus,the real bercol the drama with hia
noble sels-sacrifice for the sake ol hie master, and hie gay, gallant bearing
undar the woret reversae ol fortune. Even the Parasite is toned down ιο
aharmony with the rest ol the pictura His hunger and hie flattery
always amuse, never revolt us, and cannot be said topace the bounds
ol maron until the climax of the playia reached, when we ourselvea are
eo transported with the enthusiasm of the moment as ιο paee without
protest into hie extravagant mood. The moving passion of the playis not,
aa ol other plays, tho passion of love, generally (though the Trinummur
forme an exception) dishonourable love; it is the chivalrous devotion of a
servant ιο hie master: and it ic this change ol motiva which transforma
the whole tone of the drama
