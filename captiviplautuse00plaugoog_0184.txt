m originally declinati siem, 0110, 0ίᾶ (of. Greek c'(c)ipv, r'(o)lpr, ε’(σ)1η(τ),
010101(οΙ1101 01), nte (older 00), nent. In course of time -i- 01111010,
11110 took the piace 01 dc· 01 siena dcc, so that the declension became
0101, 010, rit, 011000, sitis, sict. In the time 01 Plautus the older forms are
in process of disappearing. We find them chiefly employed ‘metri causa’
01 the end 01 the line 01 11οω1011011,οε here. Sometimes the MSS. retain
theold spelling, where the metro requires the new form, eg. Acqrb. 979.

must supply ‘before I met Ergasilus’ Ire dixeram (see note on
v. 361). 1010111111 first syllable long. We generally write locro and
fero, but I prefer to keep to the spelling 01 the MSS. here, in view 01

1101 addito 0 ίι’0010111’01101011ιο (Of. 0100404.) It seems difficolt to draw
any sharp line between the Fut Perf. and the Fut in Plautus. Matrica]
consideratione determine the use of the former 00 much 00 anything 0100,
ils usual place being attha end 01 the line 01 hemistich (01. vv. 293, 340,
494). For its equivalence with the Fut. cf. ,10111280 Eros in 0101111000

Act 11. 800110 1. The chief lorarim comes 0111 01 the house with
his 0001010110 (followed by 001110 01 the other slaves, v. 211) 10 01001110 the
orders given by Hegio (vv. 110 sqq.). The opening passage (vv. 195 sqq.)
10 spoken while the change of fettars is being made. ln accordanee with
the poliay 01 kind treatment enjoined by Hegio (v. 114), Tyndarus who is
playing the part 01 the master, asks and obtains permission 10 have a
private conversation with Philocrates his pretended slave, in which the
scheme 101 Philocrates release is discussed.

The 1110111001 arrangement 01 this ‘mutatis modis canticum' (Gratias,
110001110ος 110)10 made difficult by the 1001 that the archetype (P) 01 001
MSS had 1101 observed with 0010 the division 01 the lines in lyric passages
The arrangement 01 the Cantica according 10 the method 01 colometry
prescribed by the Alexandrian editors 01 the Greek Dramatists (000 Introd
1. § 13) is followed in the Ambrosias Palimpsest and was 0100 followed
apparently in the pmtoarchetype (1³⁴) of the other MSS. Inone copy
01 this last, the Codex Tuniebi (Τ), 1110 division of the lines was accurately
rendered, but in that copy (P) 110111 which our extant MSS. have been
derived, it was abandoned over and over again 101 the sake 01 saving space
While the division 01 long lines was, 00 0 rule, retained, short lines were
011011 written together, the only trace of the previous arrangement being
here and there a capital 101101 111 the middle of the new line, 01 the place
where the old line had beguu (see Introd iii. ξ b). Thus in the 0000 01
Cantica, like this 0110, 101 which wc have neither the evidence 01 the
Ambrosian Palimpsest nor of the Codex Γ1111110111, 0110 00111101 be sure when
