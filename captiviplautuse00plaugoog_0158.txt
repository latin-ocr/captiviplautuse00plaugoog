94 llam Aetolia haee eat. See p. 112. It seems unlikely that we
should have in the same line two unpleesing rhythms like illito tet cupit-sis
tn Auito ‘Illic’st’ or ‘illle’st’ is a pronunciation that seems not to be
recognized by Plautus (Introd. ii. § 12), and it is highly improbable that the
last syllable ο1 captus could be elidad (Introd. ii. ξ 3). Iun is notin itself
objectionable for un often is used where irwould be expected, eg. Epio.

change the uniamiliar form illic into the familiar ille is contrary to the
laws of textual criticism. But if we remember the tendency ο1 our scribes
ω change illi Adv. to illic (see note οη v. 60), we shall see that the
alteration uli cst eaptus involves the least departure from the traditional
reading, especially as we have the Adverb in v. 330, a close parallel to this
line: nuiss mnis ilitIe] opud uos seruit copim Altae. The end of the line
would be most simply emended, if emendation were necessary, by supposing
into be a gloss at first written above Atriis to explain the unfamilinr use
ο1 the ablativa, and subsequently copied into the tert The rule ο1
Classical latin that the Preposition should be used with names of countries
and omitted with names ο1 towns is not strictly followed by Plautus.
'Thus we have in this play Altis, ‘in Elis’ (v. 330), Alz'ctnn, ‘to Elis'
(v. ers), though ouauy o liin (vv. ο, re, eu, 547, seo, eae, ers, ere)
and ia Altibus (vv. 379, 088), en Ainis (vv. 510, 1005, 1014). Redslob
thinks it possible that Plautus thought ol Elis as a town and not as a
country. A more certain example of the name of a country is Most. 440 ''r-

cepit, apparently meaning ‘took from Aetolia’ And a line quoted from
