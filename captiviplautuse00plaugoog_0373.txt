Ennius could imitate the Dectylic Heremeters oi Homer without being
driven to thnt substitution oi eooented syllables for long syllables end
oi unoooented ior short which we see in English imitatione oi Greek
dect le:
ἶ( This is the forest primeve13 the murmuring pinoe end the hern-
looks.”

But a etreeeeooent like the Lotin could hsrdly be lrept from esserting
itself in Romen poetry; end, es e matter of fect, we find that the changes
which the Greek metros undorwent in the hands of these Romen imintori
ere, in many ceses, clearly due to en attempt to reconcile the neturel
strom-ecoent of the words with the ictus or metricel beet of the line
The Dactylic Hexsmeters oi Virgil end Ovid ere hardly ellowed eny other
ending then (l) -w, -“-’, eg. moenio Romae, or( )--, --=‚ eg. mopsus
Apollo; the Dactylic Pentemeters of Ovid ere practioelly confined to the
ending mg) -ν, ν“-’, eg. praecipitata forest, nwenio moqm forent, the
leet words being by preference enclitio or subordinate words, like tibi, teus,
orat, ficii, end the like. Ii we seelr the reeeon why the Greek freedom
of choioe of endinge is abandoned by the Rornms, we shall hnrdly find
e better one then the hermony oi ictus end eooent in the ievoured endings
meniu Itoniae, mdqoue Apollo, prodmpiidia forent, nwdiiu mopso sorem, es
contreeted with the conflict oi ictus (') end secent ('') in the rejected end·
inge, eg. ‘liudem cecidieit' ‘praecipitet miiimt’ And side by eide with the
quantitative verse of literery Rome there wee ulwsys existing in Vulger
