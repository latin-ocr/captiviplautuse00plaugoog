of these two Adverbs in accordanoe with Lucilius' rule (ix. 89 11.):

Intro nos uocat ad sese, tenet intus apud 00

The use 01 irum for intro (motion ιο within), which is condemned by
Quintilian as a solecism (1.8. al ‘eo’tamen ‘intru’ 01 ‘intro sum' soloe
oisrui sunt), is not found in Plautus (01. Aria 941) But intur is common
in another sense, 01 motion from within; and thetis the original sense
both 01 imur and 01 all Adverbs in -rue, ag. pendae (Pseud 139 Atqu epu
wedre penitae, paim-i capae), fiendam, radicitus, &c The termination
(Greek -eor 01 ἐντός, ἐκτός) soon acquired the sense 01 rest within, the usual
sense ospem'troe and a common sense 01 rubim (ag. Cato 11. R xlviii. 9011
001100 bomo ambulare poerit), and indeed was extended till it became 0
mere Adverbial ending without any local sense, ag. potiturus, sollemnitas,

although altered by scribes ιο trapam was in all likelihood the only form
