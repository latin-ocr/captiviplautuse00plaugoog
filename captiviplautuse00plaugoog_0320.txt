mailro l), while attala was a popular corruption of it, due to fanciful
connexion with laeta Astale must have been the form prevalent in
Vulgar Latin, for it is the origin of the Romanoa words for ‘splinter'
(Provenqal ‘eccla' lac). ln the archetype of our MSS. the word medeam

was the purport of this suprascript entry, there is no clue to its antiquity.
It may have come down from ancient times. lt may equally be due to
some mediaeval monle There is further a possibility that vel malcaim
is a corruption of vel cordatius Adsero, The dabo of Nonius'
quotation of this line may be the reading of another ancient edition of
