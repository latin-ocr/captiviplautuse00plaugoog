Ηο10 the unimportant words 01 the sentence(1 have indicated them by
italica), the words which might almost be omitted without injury to the
sense, slip naturally into the theses 01 the linea And since Ritschl¹s tima
investigation 01 the incidence 01 metrical ictus in Plautus and Terence has
revealcd the significant 1001 that 11110, that and the other colloquial phrase
phrases which evidently come direct from the streete 01 Rome into the
Comedians’ versa observa as consistently a uniform incidence 01 ictus asa
uniform order 01 words; and that, too, 11100311 there is osten no necmity 101
this from the prosodical nature 01 the syllables comprised. The common
phrase ‘I wish to know‚’volo scire, would 11001 its prosodical natunits
arrangement 01 short and long syllablea require a metrical 000001101100

volo scire 10110101 colb scire 011001, &a But the metrical accentuation in
all the dialogus passages where the phrase occurs in Plautus is 0011 edre
(except in two where it 100110 scire, Kellerhoff in Studemund's Studien
ii 83), 00 000001001100 which agrees with the normal subordination 01 the
Auxiliary Verb volo (§ 2). Similarly the phrase 01 0010010001, wapro
010010 always scanned by Plautus 00110110 mea, with a 0101100103 01 tha
second syllable which 10 found when the next syllable hasthe natural 000001,
03. 00110111100110111010, 0011111100 (1011. ii. § 20); and this scansion
corresponds 10 that shifting 01 the 00000101 uoluptas which we should
expect 10 be produced by the enclitic appendage mea (§ 2) A common
expression 01 disappointment or despair is 001 mahero 10111, with this order
01 words and with metrical ictus on the Inmrjection and the 1001 syllable
01 melaro, not the first Here too the enclitic appendage 011111 would shift
the aocent from the first syllable 01 mucro (the syllable on which the word
would be accentedif it stood alone) to the last These who 01103 to the
theory that the Dramatists paid no rogard 10 the construction 01 their
werse to the natural accentuation 01 words, have strangely cited these
phrases as examples 01 an incidence 01 ictus that conflicta with the
elementary law of Latin Accentuation, the ‘Paenultima Law’3 for this
would require as the ordinary 0000010110 rctre, voluptas mdo, 001 abac
01111 This elementary law 01 wordaccentuation, the accentuation 01
independcnt words, is the only law to which these 1110011010 appoal Tha

different 000001 from that which they would bear 11 pronounced separately,
