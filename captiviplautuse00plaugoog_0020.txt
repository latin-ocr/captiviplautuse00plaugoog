which 666616 16 have been written in Capitol script, and therefore
16 have dated from 661 16161 than the 5111 century. Our manuscript
evidence 161 the text 61 Plautus thus resolves 1166111616 two ancient
MSS. in Capital script (with K 161 Η), 666 preserved in part (A),
the other lost (1²²). ’

13. We have indicatione that ΡΔ shared iu many respecta the
outvard form 61 A. In A there are 19 lines to the page throughout
the plays. In PA the number 666616 16 have varied between 19
(Epidicum), 20 (Casina, Badara), and 21 (Mostellaria). (See Seyffert
in Bursian’s Jatrabericlr, lm. 236, 1895.) 16 A the Cantica are
arranged according 16 the Alexandrian methodos Colometry, like that
described in Heliodorus' 66166 16 Aristophanes (sd, Thiemann, Halle,
1869), the longest lines beginning 611116 extreme left-hand margin
61 the page (ἐν ἐκθέσει), the shortest 666161 the middle 61 1116 page
(ἐν εἷο-θέσει). Ι1 we examine the lacunae in our minuscule MSS.
that are due to 116166 16 the leaves 61 ΡΔ and observo what parts 61
the 11666 have been absorbed by the same hole on the recto and
verso pages 61 the 1661, we find the same arrangement suggested.
In 1166771161 example, 66 Iambic Senarius which stood 66 the
verso page,

Sed nimium lepide dissimulant, qnasi nihil sciant,

the words 66661 nibil sciam have been cut off. The corresponding
line on the recto page seems 16 be v. 751, 6 short line 61 6
Canticum,

Gladium Casinam intus habere ait.

Only 1116 first word, gladium, 1166 disappeared ; 66 that this line
could not have begun 61 the extreme leit-hand margin, but must
have occupied about the same position in the page 61 ΡΑ as it does
16 the page 61 A. ,

Β61 although the method 61 indicating the division 61 ‘linos'
(properly cola) was probably identical in A and Pl, there 61661661·
166166666 that 111666 two early MSS. often adopted different divisione
61 6 Canticum 1616 lines, 66 that iu this respect, as in 66 many others,
A and PA represent two different early editions 61 ‘recensione' 61
the plays (see 1111 ).

11. The Sceneheadings in A and 1²* seem to have been 61
