this context to play the same metrical part in his linc as tona
would (Eum prol. 8):
Ex Graecis bonis Latinas iecit non bonas.

The emphatic utteranoe oi a short monosyllable (or elidad disyllable)
similarly obscured the unstressed initia] syllable ol the following
word, eg. Marc. 971 Vtrum hic dicit Pseu) tago dicit Ε(ο) suad
est verum magis, Pom 881 qaid ergo dubitasl

18. Το what extent this assimilation of quantity to a preceding
short syllable was carried out in pronunciation would depend partly
on the speaker himself. An educated man would be less prone to
slnr or weaken his syllables than an uneducated. The same speaker
in ordinary careless talk would pay less regard to their dne, quanti-
tative pronunciation than he would in formal, ceremonious disoourse
To what extent it should be recognized in poetry was oi course
a matter ior each individual poet to decide, though in the case
oi some words, as we have seen (eg. bem, mole), the power oi
decision was taken out oi hia hands; so strongly had popular usage
declared ior the shortened form. Ennius in his Epic Poetry restricto
himself to the shortened pronunciation only oi final vowels, in the
weakening oi which another factor was at work, viz. the shortened
pronunciation oi these before an initial vowel (below, 538), and
mainly the final vowels oi iambic words (indua. 63Μ.1ιι(11“στὶἰε
probably Neut. Sg. oi a 3 Decl. by-iorm3 ci. ς 26), though we have
occasional scansione like virgiaco (Ana. 102 M. ; oi. Plaut. Pera.
845, if the reading be correct):

Virgines nam sibi quisque domi Romamm habet sas

Subsequent Dactylic Poets practice the same restrictiori and
make more and more sparing uae even of these shortenings. But
every now and then they give us a glimpse oi the real everyday
pronunciation by their occasional departures from the rules oi classical
poetry; (15111 Lucil. ix. 29 M.. vidia (Virg.)‚ 1111101151, Hor., Ouid),
volo (Catull. vi. 16), dabo (Catull. xiii. 11), horno (Lucr. vi 652),
scio (Virg. Ecl. viii. 43, Aea. iii. 602), eo (Hor. S. ’a 6.119),1111
(Hor. S. i. l. 104), palas (Hor. A. P. 65), royda (Pers. v. 134), dicero

(Hor. S. i. 4. 104), amatio (Hor. S. i. 4. 93), qacnwdc (Hor. S. i 9.
43), ore corrupto (Lucil. ix. l Μ), ancara corruptum (Lucr. vi 1135).

And in the ‘popular' dactylic poetry oi Epitaphs and the like
we have eg. 1111111 (OM. i 1297), royda (i. 1454), daturap (i. 1453),
ochi (i. 1442). So pollet on a Pompeiam Graffito (CM. iv. 1624) :

¹ Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus.
