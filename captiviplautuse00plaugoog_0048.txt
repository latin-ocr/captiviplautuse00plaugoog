Here, 1001110 shortening of a vowel naturally long 10 so rare
00 10 excite suspicion. The most clearly attested shortenings are
oi ὅ (hx, lc) and 11 (ab), eg. 111111ιὲ1111 (Mero. 774; cf. teas-
aimone Poen. 1078), quid ct 110ὁί0 1110111111 capt. 206.

Other polysyllabis groups bave more resemblance to lambio
words :—

22. (f) Monosyllabic words joined iu utterauce into a word-group
with a single aocent. A phrase like quie 11110 currit? would have
the accentuation of a phrase consisting of an iambis word followed by
amit (see Appendir), qais-buccabrit like miser 0111111. Whether the

ascentor 1110 first monosyllable or the accent on the longer word
would be the more foroible depended on the nature and nuanoe of
the phrase. In such word-groups a long (ewen long by nature)
monosyllabis subordinate or enclitic word, eg. 11110, llaec, is frequently
shortened under the Law 01 Breves Breviantes‚ eg. quie 11110 01101111,
quta 11010 aaut, quod 1110 1(0) orat Poen. 1024, 111 1οἔ0 tavmiomor
Poeia 1171.

Sometimes 1110 011011 preceding syllable 10 composed not 01 amonoeyllabio

udimte word is an elided disyllable, ag. 11010110), Aul. 831 uel hercle 611100.
Sometimes the word-group is as capable 01 being classed with the instanoes
