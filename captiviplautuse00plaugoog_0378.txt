of Plautus and even of Terence, unless where the presence of an enclitic
causes a shifting of the acuent (similarly with word-cndings oi this form,
eg. marino, a noun which takes the ictus on the second syllable in its
single occurrence in Terence, Haut. 183:

Abddxi ed cenam: nim mihi magnacum e6 iam inde a pueritia)
Words of the type -2-2, eg. tenpestate, advenies, are by the nature of
lambio and Trochaic verse restricted tc the ictus thaps-stote, Moenus,
which corresponds with their accentuaticn tenpestate, ddveatte; and much
the same is true of words of the typo 2--2, eg. sepelire, eockratcr (see
ξ la). Ohon‘ambic words, eg. corniliano, dimidius, have usually the
ictus mione, dimidius, which corresponds to their accentuation under
the Paenultima Low, though the ictus cerellium, dimidius, &c (like the
older accentuation of the first syllable, ξ l) is not at all infrequent

Other combinatione ol icur syllables oi tha type m! are nealy used with
ictus on the second oi tha group, eg. Ie edom (lapid. 524), An obiit (Mero. 981),
where ictus and aoeent would not be in condiat. similarly in combinatione cl
three syllables oi the type --2' other than in trisyllabio words or in the audinga
ci polysyllabis words the ictus is readily allowed on the second oi the grean
eg. Sed ubi (llud. 466). Thia ahews that it is consideratione ci the natural
wcantnation ci these Fourth Paeon and Tribraeh words whioh determine their
matrioel treatment by the Latin Dramatists.

Since the diction ci these poets is patently the diction of the ordinary life
of the time, and their dialoguescenee reproduee all the varied phasea of
cveryday speech, with its tenes of banter and innuendo, of entreaty and
refusal, of threatening, command and deprecationtheyaffcrd usanexcellent
