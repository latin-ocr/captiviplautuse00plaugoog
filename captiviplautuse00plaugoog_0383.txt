have been subordinate, end thia subordination or enclieia would imply in
Intin ita fusion with the noun into e. wordcomplex, opadmdobom (ef pce
rum-do, castnedo). We cannot then find a oonflict of accent and ictrn in
euch phrnaee from Terence ae:

Act 473 fidemnon iurans ee sslam ducturdm domum,

19. Among subordinate Nonne like our ‘thing,’ ‘kind’ ‘ pert' in euch
phrases aa ‘something of that kind' ‘acme parte of England’ we may
reckon in Latin rea (eg. quere, quomobrem), modm (eg. quomodo, qumod
mum), locro in the adverbiel word-grcupe abilocif, {amoenet de
Donatus in hie note on Ter, Bitu 255 (IL ii 24):
dnm heac loquimur, interea loci ad macellum ubi aduentdmua,

tella ue that interea-loci formed a word-group with accent on a, the laet
syllable of interea and the antepenultimate of the word-grcup In Plautua

we have aheady aeen the subordination of ree in the phreeeei iffi) opernm
dabam inveriebly echoed by the incidence of ictus on the Pmnoun Halo
ree, the equivalent of malum, ‘punishment’ ‘evil in etore‚’ seems to bea
word-group with metricel ictus corresponding to the accentuation nahra,
molae-r& mammem, marceo, eg. flia. 1045:

hercle istie niolam rem magnam mdribue digndmat deri

Similarly bonus vir ahowa normally the ictua bonne-cir (final e uairally did
not produce length by ‘position' in the time of Plautus), ttae-vir, ee
The same subordination of cir is seen in the common phme acolis ciri
‘thc wretch‚' which exhibita the normal ictus of a Fourth Paeon word,
aolfu-vimi The phrase mmo horno (a curious indication of the early dett.²
of the reduction of bohemo) takes the ictua elweye on the first syllable,
medullione (Seyffert in Burainn'e detrectet-ioht, 1894, p. 329).

20. Pmpcaitions were fused with a following Noun into a compcund
word end would be entirely without atreus in a group like admonente, asin
a compcund Verb like aconem but before an enclitie or unemphatic Pro
noun they would doubtleae teke en nocent, ‹fd-me, adeum, like Greek πρὸς
με, Engl. ‘to him‚’ ‘for him: Early Iriah for-m ‘on me‚' for-t ‘on thee'
Thia treatment of thc Prepoaition before an unemphatic Prononn a
reflected in every page cf Plautus and Terence, who hardly ever relegate
it ιο the thenis unicae the Pronoun is elided, eg. ad-m(e) dducam and it
ia likely enough thet the elisicn cf the Proncun restored the Prepoaitionin

actual pronunciation ιο ite unecoented atate. A good example of the
treatment of the group when the Pronoun has emphasis ia„ seen in
