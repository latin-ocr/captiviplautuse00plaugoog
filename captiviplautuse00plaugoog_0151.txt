Euonslnvs parasitus.

Act 1. Scene i. Our division of the plays into numbered Acts and
Soenes dates only from the Renaissanoe editions and though useful for
purposes ot reference should not have any prominenee assigned tait ln
the ancient recensione the only division was that indicated by the scene

hesdinge. These were written as a rule in two linea the name of the
speaker in the first and his ‘rdle' in the second, eg.

unamve
ramma

In every early archetype of the ‘Palatina' recension the first lines of
these scene-hesdinge had been lost, though they were in most cases
supplied by conjecture in a later copy (see Introd. i ξ 14). That is why
our MSS. here offer only the title οἰ the rdle, esaum. Osten however
the soene-hesdinge seem to heve occupied one line, instead of two, and to
have comprised only the proper names, not the rdles (eg. ua iil, iiii, iv. 1,
v. 1, tv. ia, v. i., iii, ia).

Ergasilus, the parasitel, comes on the stage, looking very lean and woe-
begone (cf. vv. 91 sqq.‚ 1³3 sqq.), and lamenta the absence of his young
patron Philopolemus, with ite attendant inconveniences sor himself.

This opening scene euricusly resembles that of the Menaechmss whose
prologus too, as already mentioned (p. 115), with its laboured explanation
of a somswhat intricate plot, reminds us ol the prologus to the Captivi
The parasite in the Menaechmi begins, like Ergasilus, with an arowal ot
his niclmame:

iuuentus nomen fecit Peniculo mihi,
ldeo quia mensam, quando edo, detergeo,

and goes on to suggest that the most binding letters for a prisoner in tha
‘ergastulum’ would be a good dinner:

Esca atque potione uinciri decet
Apud mensam plenam homini rostri deliges

He mentions the hounty os the ‘aduleeoens’ Menaechmus (as Ergasilus
praises Philopolemus), to which however he hae reeently been a sti-anger:
