analogous took place iu latin (and I see no reason lor doubting it) euictus
like that ol emto-me, ‘save me‚’ in Cure. 628:

cannot be quoted as an example of the oonfliet of ictus and aooent The
nocent of the imperative standing alone would be droa, but the word·
group mma-me would take the same accentuation es a single word like
muamus, senaim, modu. (On the line-beginning poter aocet me Amph
991 see Intr. iii. ξ 8.) An example of the emphatic pronoun is Men 1076:

tu erue es; tu eeruom quaere3 tu seluet03 tu uale
ilbi eqo dico, ‘d’ye hearl,’ hae normslly the ictus noi epo dico (a list of
examples will be found in Kaempl, Prmrorn. Perroaol. p. 17),

eg. ital ‘mio' and ‘mo’ (ae in ‘me-donna')¹‚ point to an emphatic end

ἰέ the versification of the comediam If we contrast, for example
apt. 261:

ut uos hic, itidem ssli apud uos nuos seruatur fssius,

and its emphatic mem, with the subordinated Posseesive in a line like

Bacch 251:

we shall not be inclined to agree with those who find in the poter of Ter.
Ad. 983 en instance of conflict between aocent and ictus:

Plautus, aad capitoleo (for details see Niemoeller, Ipse ct Idem, p. 37).

eqo is root, which in Plautus always take the ictus on ie, ae contrasted with
the ordinary unemphatic usage, eg. proptercoe, praem-eos. It ie seen too
in a line like Poen. 394:

18. The common phrase ἃ rei operam dodam (dabo, dvc.) takes in the
lines of Plautus the ictus on the Pronoun and on the last syllable oi operam,

the subordination of the noun res (ξ 19) and of the verbulo. Just as we
