summor, dicuutur (3 Pl. Pres Imperat).

But -sar 01 matur, curetur, legitur 010. (0 sg. Pras.) had always a short
vowel, originally ὅ (Gk. ο 01 ehem-ro 110), then c. 'l'he derivation 01 igitur
is unknown; also 01 mulier (0001110 es Mil. 1000, v.l. 00110010).

The vowel in these terminatione, too, was originally long. Orator
had the long o 01 ῥήτωρ, dicor, diamur of dico, (11000110. Βο1 linalr
exercised the same shortening effect on a preceding long vowel as
was exercised by final 1, though 001 perhaps so rapidly. Ennius
seems not to know the short scansion (lassddr A. 455 Μ.); but it is
the scansion 01 Lucilius (eg. 01111111οῙ00. 90 M.‚fmnisetr xviii. 3 Μ.).
Final n did not effect the quantity 01 0 preceding long vowel, eg.
audin, Asin. 598 dic, eporedia, from audis-ae, spondiacus, suada
10000 sumasne (as in the iambis lineending 001010 eal Truc 364);
but final l had this effect after the time 01 Plautus, eg. class. animal.

This ·al 01 luctuosissima 110 was originally 010(Νο01. Sg. 01
Adj. in 0110),οῃ(1 in Plautus’ time these words had probably the
nocent on the final syllable (App. 5 7) and retained the long vowel,
enimultra

Examples 01 these scansions are: 00010 11000. 590, 1005010000. 805 (100 s

whether 1001150 may be the Plautine scansion is not olesr. Sea Pseu. 1170,

2. Others were long by position (ending in a double consonant)
in the time 01 Plautus, while in class. Latin they took exclusively
the pronunciation (with a single consonant) which 01 an earlier period
they had only before a word beginning with a consonant. Thus
while Plautus and his contemporaries pronounced miltes imprecasse
and miles prmus (cf. 1000 erut and hoc suit), the later usage recog·
nined only the pronunciation with one s (Lot. Luotp. iii. ᾖ 50).

Also ter (for *term cf. termmcius); cor (100 1100011), 010.

How 100 the spelling mileu hc. was in vogue is impossible to
say¹. The MSS. 01 Plautus point to ess, ‘thou art,' in liud. 240 and

¹ On the oldest Latin (and Greek) inscriptions a double consonent is always

written single, though 01 course pronounced double. But about tha time ol
Plautus the new fashiou os writing it double was coming in (Lat. sano. i. fi 8).
