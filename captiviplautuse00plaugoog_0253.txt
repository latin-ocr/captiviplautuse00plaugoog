act 111. Scene ii Hegio, accompanied by Aristophontes, an Elean
captive whom he has found in his brother's crymtnlum, comes on
the stage by the left-hand door, and singe a song, in expression of his
delight at the speedy prospect of recovering his captured son. ‘l'his
bright, lively Canticum, with its rapid variation of matres, stands in
marked contrast to the dejected Palinode of Act rw, Sc. ii. lts arrange
ment offers considerable difficulty; for in the Archetype of our MSS. the
original division of lines 490-903, and probably of others too, has been
abandoned for the sake of sowing spara Ι suppose the first and third
lines to be Anapaestic Dimetcrs, the second and fourth Bacchiae Tetra
metere (though in the second the pyrrich scansion 990 is not what we

for the expression of a rapid sequence of incidente. 'l'he next line is
generally scanned aa a Bacchiae Tetrameter, but the shortening of the laet
syllable of dico and the ictus on the second are quite unlikely. It may be
an lambio Dim CataL with a Bacch. Dim. Then comes an Anapnestic
Tetrameter Aoatalectic, followed apparently by a couple of lines composed
of a Trochaic Dimater Oetelectic and a ‘colon Reizianumss The sucoeeding
line may be a Trochaic Dimater Acotalectic with the same ‘colon Rei·
sianum.¹ V. 513· is a Trochaic Dimater Aoatalectic, and the last two
lines are Iambic.
