³0. Indeudlult. The old proposition erdo, ‘in,' ‘into' (cf. ok ἔνδοθι,
ἔνδοθεν, futes), luter spelt indo end indu, hed dropped out of uee before
the time of Plautus. It remained in compounde like indo-eum, indu·
perator, indupedio, ίηάψρνοᾱίον, meet of which were in time oueted by
the rivel compounde within: intueri, imperator, inepedia inpedior, only a

metro iu vv. 59, 880. We must suppose either thet captiua ie e corruption
of caprimon (as in epid. 664 captam and captivam ure confused in the
MSS), or that eome word hae dropped out of the line (coptum <unum>
