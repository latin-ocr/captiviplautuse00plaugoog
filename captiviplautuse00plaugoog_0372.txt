wando. (6) Prepesitions (as opposed to Adverbe). Before Nonne in
latin orthography these were often written as in Gompound Verbs, eg. r'n
sarrana, in temptam were written incursum, interrplem like inum, dre.

(7) Relatives or Indefinitee (as opposed to Interrogatives) (ot. ‘th is >
the person who denies irr’). (8) Certain Conjunotions, unless specially
emphasired Thus Donatus mentions the different signification conveyed

by aocented and unacoented ri in the phrase ri quondo (see below). The
accentuation oi si implied doubt on the partos the speaker. (For details

of Latin Sentence-Aocentuation see my Latia lungowe, ch nn)

a The Latin Grammerians generally content themselves with citing
these words as the Latin equivalents of the Greek Enolitioe (re, ἐστι, τις,
eir, cl, dre), and do not state the precise details of their pronunciation in
latin, a statement which would indeed imply more familiarity with the
scienoe of Phonetics than could be expected in their time Quintilian
however gives us the valnable hint that these subordinate words in
latin were really tused into a compound with their neighboun'ng word,
eg. circrrmitorc in Virgil (luet Or. n v. 25: mern dico ‘cimanlltora'
tanquam unum anurnio dissimulato dr'etinctione, itaque tuaquom in uno
noce una cet amaa), though how far we may prese tho conclusione that
seem naturally to result from his statement is doubtful It hae been
suggested that in postposition of the Relative, eg. Troice qui primm ab
orn's...oenit, the enclitic or subordinate Pronoun would be joined in pro-
nunciation inte one word-group with the preceding N oun with aocentuation
Μαί-φῖ. (Ol. qni homo, a word-group in Plautus, scanned qai-homo.)
At any rate we may be certain that in Latin, as in other languagea an
enclitic became aocented before another enclitio. Prepositions were sub
ordinate in etmss to the noune which they accompany, eg. ari-artem, but
before an enclitic pronoun would receive the accent, eg. ‹td-me. Oi. our
‘with-him' ‘scr-him’ When the pronoun was emphatic, it of course would
receive the strecs, eg. cd-me non ccl-tl. cf. our ‘with-him, not with-her)

4. The Latin Acuent was mainly an accent ot stress, and different
from the Greek eocent oi tonsor pitch, though its stress was not strong
enough, except in special circumstances (see lntr. ii. ξ ll), to overrnaster
the quantity of a vowel An educated Roman pronounoed mator with the
stress of the voice on the second syllable, but without impairing the
quantity of the initia] 03 the final o ot pono retained its length, in spite
oi the fact that the stress of the voice fell on the first syllable; the tirst
syllable ni piper had the stressecoent along with the short quantity. and
so on¹. lt was thus possible ior the Romans to imitate the quantitative
metree os the Greeks, in which the harmonicus or metrical clement of the
line consisted of the regular arrangement cf long and oi short syllables

¹ But in course of time strecs conquered quantity. In the early Empire pond
became the universal pronunciation, and we hear later ol orator arrd piper as
current mispronnnciations (Consentius, p. ³91 Κ).
