7. Apocopeted words torm an exception to the rule that the Latin
accent (unlike tha Greek) never falls on the final syllable. The Latin v
Grammaticus quota as examples such words as illic ior illido), warda for
16616616), Pyrrhia for Pyrrhi-nlo} That this pronunciation was departed
from under special circumstances we 666 from the remark of Servius
(ad Aera vi. 779) that aaa (ie. vides-m» was the actual pronunciation
of his time Plautus too scens videa as hc often 66666 ciclos, and similarly
in other cases of elidad orda), -6(6). Thus we find prospcrlqa(c) (Amph. 46&
cf. Pseud. 674), 66 we find prospere on ooeasion The normal incidence
cf ictus on such word-groups is the same as that on the single word,
6616166666) like eucapiae, hc, and may quita well reflact the actual
pmnunciation (ior details sae Ahlberg in broad Dmetcriom, 1897, p. 31).
The classical scansion oi Neuter Adjectives which have lost final c and

16666666 N cuns, eg, ockdr, 66616ιᾶ1, miserti, shews that this rule oi the
Grammarians had not been observed in their case either. But the inter-
mediste stage between, eg. 116661166ἅὰ and 1666116661, must have been

hema& and the word appears with this quantity and this ictus in
Aah 411:

atttt perii hercle ego miser: aperitur bacchanah adest.

The different incidence of ictus in illi and illic, both ef which were in the
time of Plautus used either es the Adverb ‘there' or as Dativa of the
Pronoun ‘tc him,' has been obscured by the scribes of the MSS. oi Plautus,
who have usually changed illi Adv. 16 the classical illic, and illic Dat. to
the classica] illi, eg. capt. 278:

quod genus 1111 ast dnum pollens atque honorabesumnm,

where the MSS. offer illic, the classical form, but where the metra requires
illi. That Plautus used roam, harunc (with this incidence of ictus) but
horum, hdr-um before a werd beginning witha consonant is certain (see
Studemund, Jahrb. Phil. cxiii p 57), though this usage 166 16 often
obscured by the MSS. In Pseud. 69, for example, tortae uoluptatum the
Ambrosian Palimpsest 61666 hae preserved the true reading horunc, while
the Palatino MSS. have altered it 16 the more familiar laram. Tha normal
ictus qaid 16116 or quid nde, quid 16166 or qaid 161166, agrees with what the
Grammarians 1611 us of the strong strecs on the Interrogative and of the
oxytone nature of 16116, istrie (for estad-cc).

Seyffert (in Berl. Philol. Wocbemcbnfl, xviii. 1577) 616166 that potio, videa,
61116616.. are never round to represent 66 iambus at the eud oi 6 1166 or hemi·
atich in Plautus (ci. lntr. ii, 53).
