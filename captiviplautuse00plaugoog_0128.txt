lmowledge be conveyed to thern except through the Prologus, sor the only
actor in the piece who could bave enlightened thern is Stalagmus ; and he
does not appear on the soene till the playis nearly over. There ie, too,
another justification for the narrative in the prologus. The plays ol the
Republican Dramatiste were performed in the open air on some public
holiday to achance crowd Δ complicated plot like that of the Captivi,
including tha assumption by Philocrates of the part of Tyndarus and by
Tyndarus oi the part oi Philocrates, would require to be explained twice
to such an audiente What appears to ue garrulosa prolixity in some of
the prologues ot Plautus was due to the practical necessity of securing the
attentim and the intelligence os a restleea crowd of holidayseekera. In
the Amphitruo, where Jupiter personates King Amphitruo and Mercury his Ι
slave Sosia, there is along prologus in which the spectatore are first coaxed
into good humour and attention, and finally, after being told the plot of
the pices, are informed that the divine ‘Sosia’ will wear leuthers on hie
cap to distinguieh him from his human counterpart, while Jupiter, in the
dress of Amphitruo, will be recogniced by the golden knob under his head-
gear. Therimachus, the original of the Corrudp of Iu'rrorr, is another
example of a complicated plot requiring a long, audior our modern teste
overdetailed, prologus.

Of the ncisy, restless crowd, to which a dramatis author at Rome had
to submit his productim, we get a lively picture in the prologus to the
Poenulus, where the speaker, assuming the functione ol a military com·
munder (inperator Ιιὲεεήαα v. 4), issuee regulations tor the discipline of his
rsw leriae, vv. ll eqq.: ,

Exsurge, praeco, fac populo audientiam
............ edicta ut seruatis mea

Scortum exoletum ne quie in proscaenio

Sedeat, neu lictor uerbum aut uirgae muttiant,
Neu dissignator praeter os obambulet

Neu sessum ducat, dum histrio in scaena siet
Diu qui domi otiosi dormierunt, decet

Animo aequo nunc stent, vel dormire temperent.
Serui ne obsideant, liberis ut eit locus,

Vel aes pro capite dent; si id facere non queunt,
Domum abeant, uitent ancipiti infortunio,

Ne et hic uarientur uirgis et loris domi,
siminus censeant, quom eri reueniant domum.
Nutrices pueros infantie minutulos

Domi ut procurent neu quae spectatum adferat,
Ne et ipsae sitiant et pueri pereant fame

Neue esurientes hic quasi haedi obuagiant.
Matronae tacitae spectent, tacitae rideant,
Genera hic uoce aua tinnire temperent,
