Nugis, ineptias? incipissa haereo.
But th'e scansion -tdr in· aa an Anapaest in an Iambic line is vary doubtful
(Introd iii. ξ 9), though the hiatus at the pause before haereo is legitimata
as is the change of person (of. vv. taccat). Leo alters ineptias, which
he regards as un-Plautine, to ineptae:
Nugae ineptus incipisso. haereo

(nopae referring to the intended trick of denouncing Aristophontes aaa
madman). The nonoccurrence of ineptia (used by Terence) elsewhere in
Plautus, except in the prologue to the Mercator (v. 26), is not sufficient
ground for doubting the genuineness of the word, in view of the frequency
of the Adj. ineptas, the Adv. inepte, &c; and ineptos in this line seems to
me unlikely to be right Brix thinks the line should be Oretic. Iambic
metra is more probablo, since v. 530 is lambio. The least alteration oi
the traditional text is the change of ineptias to imptiana I have also
thought of changing ineptias to ineptia and imposne to incipiam, and in
v. 531 maxumas to mammeri, all of them changes warranted by the cler-icil
errors of our MSS. ol Plautus (eg. Pera. 491 libertas sor libertast). (On the
Verb incipniro see note on v. 802.)

Act 111. Scene iv. Hegio, accompanied by Aristophontes and
(apparently) by the slaves (see note 011 v. 551) who have been appointed
to keep watch on Tyndarus, comes out of the house in search of the
captive. Tyndaris, with that jaunty reckleasnees which we should call
characteristically irish, adopts the atrox colmie (v. 5³8) of pretending to
Hegio that Aristophontes is a dangerous lunatio. We have quite as funny
a soene with the supposed mcdman as in the Menaechmi (Act v, Sc. ii—v.),
but the inevitable conclusion comes at last, the discovery of the plot oi the
two Captivos This is the longest Scene in the play, but the interest never
flags for a moment; and we may be sure that the audience would have
welcomed en even longer Scene The same variation oi Trochaic with
lambio Metro, that we remarked in the last Scene, is kept up at the
beginning of this one, until the discovery of Tyndan1s(v. 540).* All the
rest of the Scene isin Trochaic Septenarii, the common metrical expression
