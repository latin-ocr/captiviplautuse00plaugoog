(Cf. 5 33; and ior fuller details oi the ‘Ambmsian' and ‘Palatino'

Oolometry, Studemund, dc Contione Plautinis Berlin, 1864.) Un-
iortunately the original Colometry oi the ‘Palatino' recension has
been to a great extent obscured in tho extant representatives oi the
‘Palatino' family, owing to the scribe oi their immediate original
(P) having combined two or more short lines into one long line, and
in various ways having departed from the colometry oi the proto
archetype ior the sake oi saving speech Where wc have nottho
testimony oi the Ambrosian Palimpsest we are often left in great
uncertainty regarding the proper arrangement oi a Canticum. The
discussion whether Plautus used this or that peculiar length of line,
ie. the Bacchiae Trimetor, is scarcely pmfitable, since in the first
place, in a large number oi Cantica we cannot be sure oi Plautus'
own distribution oi the lines, and in tho second, where there is a
‘system' or continuous runci a particular metro, the division oi this
‘system’ into lines is usually a mere matter oi caprice.

The Anapaectio ‘system’ Pseud. 1³15 sqq.. was written in the ‘Ambrosiun¹
rocension in Tetrameters, in the ‘Palatino’ as Dimetors3 and most mser ol
divergenoe iu the ‘Ambrosian ’ and ‘Palatino' Oolometry are merely equivalcnt
methods ol writing down a metrica} ‘system' 'I'he curione ‘clausulae’ which
are a feature of the Golometry ol the Ambrosian Palimpscst, seem to indicata a
metrical ‘system’z eg. Oua. 673, a bacohiac passage, written in A:

Α. Quid cnm ea
negoti tibist? B. Peooaui:

might be printed thus:

s. Quis eun a negoti uuae a. remu: unu ulca anisum uoluam, ’

as seren Baochii (the sixth defective, 5 83), or thus (Trim. and Terram:

Α. Quid crim ea negdti tibist? B. Pec-
