of the Bacchides (circ. vv. 35-80, ovo-650, 810-900), has been

3. Three other MSS„ written in Germany, are descended from
6 common original (P). ⁴ It must have been a transcript made from
PA at a later time than the 'P-text was transcribed. For in four 1
passages of the 1166666 (vv. 648 666, 666 sqq., 698 sqq„ 712 sqq.),
where the torn sides of two leaves in Pl left a lacuna at the
beginnings and ends of the lines, the scribe of P seems to bave
found less than the scribe oi Τ (or of 666 original from which ¹1·
was copied). V. 700, for example, Ne indignum id 666666 666.Δ
began with the word 666666 16 Ρ, 666 with indipnam id 66666616 ⁸1⁸.
066 may conjecture, 666 16 16 66 more than a conjecture, that PA had
been transmitted from France to Germany for the purpose of being
copied for 6 German monastery library and had suffered in the
transmission. The number of lines to a page in PA may be inferred
from 666 1666666 16 666 11661666 audather plays to have been from
19 to 21 (see ἓ 13). Nineteen is the uniform number of lines to 6
page in the Ambrosian Palimpsest3 and that PA was in Capital script
like the Ambrosian Palimpsest is suggested (hardly proved) by the
fact that in P the letter 6, which 666 16 666 0661661 script 61 666
Ambrosian Palimpsest and other Latin MSS. 6 Κ-1οη6, was often
confused with the letter lc. Some 61 166 spellings, 6666 1666666, kuic
for 6616, hc. (86666. 105, 108, 110, 169 dvc), have been faithfully

reproduced 16 666 Codex Vetus (Β) (666 below). The number of
lines to 6 page in P itself was apparently 33 (see below).

4. In dealing with the descendants of P it will be convenient
to discuss separately MSS. 61 666 first eight plays (Ampe-Epa„
with the exclusion of the Bacchides) and MSS. of 666 last twelve¹
