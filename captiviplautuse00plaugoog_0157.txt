90. vu, asin 132, 183. The scansion uel {rc (amporam must be

excused hy the unstmssed (enclitic) pronunciation of iro in this phrase
(cf. our ‘to go home,' ‘to go back,' with strecs on ‘home' and ‘back'l
Rven so, tha shortsning of a naturally long syllable in a wordgroup of
this kind by the Law of Brevee Breviantes is abnormal (see Introd ii 9 2l);
and Bothe's theory is very attractiva, that Plautus wrote Vol etro-m
(cf. v. 469), which was at some stage or other ol the histoiy of the text
‘modamized‘ to Vel irc exoa-licet. Portam binominum. “The
Porta momina was in the short pieoe ol the wall between the Aventino
Mount and the river3 through it the read led to Ostia It was probably
so called from having three arches, but it was connected in legend with
the Trigemini Horatii.” Hallidie. flaccum denotes the sack of the
portet (boiutuc), to judge from the resolve of the parasite in Alciphron iii 7
ἐπ’ ἐργασίαν τρέψομαι καὶ Πειραιᾶδι βαδιοῦμαι, τὸ c'x'roir ναῶν φορτία ἐπὶ τὰς
deoduinus μισθοῦ μετατιθείς. Others understand a reference to begging,
which was praotised at the gates ol towns, and find a parallel in ma 423
Pater quom peregre uenia, in portoct ζοαια (cf. tkyhzcistoc Aul 618, from
θυλακίζα, to bcg, a derivative of θοἍακοι, a bag or pouch). But οαοοιιι
rather suggests a sack carried by a poiter (later manius), than a beggam
wellet Livy xxxv. 10 (cf. xli. 27) speaks of on emporium ool merim which
existed extra portam Trigeminam as early as 193 no Ergasilus seems to
have thought of employment aa a portei- there

91. Tho spondeeword (nullum) in the fourth foot injums the rhythm
(see note on v. 24 διο). Non nullum, an unusual expression, and one
indeed inconsistent with Plautus’ uae os the double negative in lines like
uad. 359 Nec te abutor ncdlve est sapienter. The terme nonnulli, conuento,
mauu &o came into vogue at a later time. (Noc nibal in v. 864, Νοο
nobil hodie uec multo plus tu hio adea, is not an example of this usage)

92. Rex (βασιλεύς), the colloquial word for a patron, frequent in the
Oomedians &c nst potitus hostium (cf. 144, 769, ΕΜ. 532 gaam ιιιαα
mulcent potita), the Passive of potire aliquem elmuino rei, eg. Amph 178
Eum none petiuit poter seruitium The Verb is used of undesirable as well
’ as of good things (cf. Donatus ad Tor. Plena. 111. i. 5:469 potiri τῶν
μέσων fuit). Lucr. iv, 766 has eum mortu letique pontum (contrast Auson
Idyl. xv. 50 morte potin), and the phrase ιιοοιζι potior occurs on an epitaph
