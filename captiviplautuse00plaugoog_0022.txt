And tho same neglect oi the ‘rubricator’ to supply Scene-
headings, ‘notae personarum,’ and the marks C and DV reappears
in various descendants of ΡΑ from timeto time, and has led to the

almost total disappearance oi the ‘notae personarum’ and these
marks from our MSS)

The same type of Sceneheadings is found in the Codex Bembinus
(bth cent) of Terence. The Didascaliae of the Bembinus show the
same variety ol lines in red and black. of the Plautino Didascaliae
we have only two examplos (Studcmund in commentationes Moram·
oeaicncc), those ol the Stichus and Pseudolus in A, where the blech
lines only remam, the red lines having boen washed out. In 1³A the
Didascaliae seem not to have been present.

lt. The Argumenta prefixed to the plays oi Plautus arc of two
kinds, Aorostic and non-Acrostic. In 1³A the Acrostic Argumenta
were used, with the addition occasionally (Δηρὼ, aar, Mera, Mil.)
of the non-Acrostic². In A no Argumenta were written hythe
scribe, but non-Acrostic Arguments have been added in a later

(oth century) hand in Uncial script wherever a suitable blank space
’ was avallable (Pera, Pseud, Sciet).

16. The Order of the Playe id different in A and ΡΛ, though
the arrangement in alphabetic groups is the same. The M-groop in
A follows this order: Mera, Most, Mil, Mea.; in ΡΑ, Most,
Mers, Ma, Merc.; the P·group in A, Poro, Pers, Pseud, in Pl,
Pseud, Pom, Pers. The position oi the Bacchides alter the
Epidicus in our minuscule MSS. (due to the reference to the

Epidicus in Bacch. 214) is probably later than ΡΛ, to judge from the
gap at the end of Aul. and beginning oi Baccl.

17. Besides those differences of A and ΡΑ with regard to
Oolomotry, Sceneheadings, Didascalico, Argumenta, and Order of
Plays, there are differences of text. From the remarks ol the
Grammarians and Iexicographers of the Empire we can see that
varieties of text, in other words various editions of Plautus, were
prevalent; and some oi these varieties we lind reproduced in A

¹ 'l'hrough the greater part of the Trinummor, however, the ‘notae perso-
narum’ are retained in B, via. A for Megaronides, B for callicles, A (lep. Al) ior
Philto,ll for Lesbonicus, Ζ ior Lysiteles, K lor Stasimus. For the remains ol
the marks Oend DV which occasionally persist even in the loth century Mes
sse Bitschl‚ Opere. iii. pp, lsqq. and add to his list those ol the Codex Turnehi
and of the Lsyden 12th century MS. (V) (see Schoell’s edition ol the Casina).

²Thst these came from the margin into the text is suggested hy tha lact
that in Amph„ Aut, they precede, bnt in Merc.. tria, follow the Acrostio.
