The singularity of the play, its utter differenoe from the ordinary
entertaiument of aholiday, is expressly aolmowledged in the Prologus

(vv. 54 sqq.):
profecto expediet fabulae huie operam dare:
non pertractate facta est neque item ut ceterae,
neque spurcidici insunt uersus inmemorabilee:
hic neque periurus leno est nec meretrix mela ιω

and in the Epilogus (vv. 1029 sqq.):

spectatores, ad pudicos mores facta haecfabula est...
huiusmodi paucae poetae reperiunt comoedias,

ubi boni meliores fiant nunc uos, si uobis placet,

et si placuimus neque odio fuimus, signum hoc mittite,
qui pudicitiae esse uoltis praemium: plausum date

Thet the new venture was not found too insipid for the teste of a Romen
audianos we mayinfer from the traces of a later revivel of the piace

(see note on v. 1022). In modam times it has found imitatem, the best
known being Ariosto in, his Sappon‘ti, and Oalderon in his Primos
Germania.

To its Greek original we oan get no clue whatever. 'I'he various
hypotheses that have been put forward are so unsupportsd hy evidence
as hardly ιο deservo mentiou², and the discovery of a Greek papyrus·
fragment in Egypt may at any moment give ue sure knowledge in the
roem of vague surmise. We are equally destitute of information about the
relation ol the Isatin play to its original: whether the latin text reproducee
the Greek with exactnees, or whether other plays were drawn upon for
materiale, we cannot say‘.

Of the date of the Latin adaptation we have more eahsmctory indica-
tione in the jokee in vv. 90, 888, which suggest the year 183 ne. (eea
the notes to these lines); for allusione like these may fairly be supposed
ιο tumim something more theu a mere ‘terminus a quo’ for dating. 'l'he
facts referred ιο must have been contemporary, not removed hya lapse of
time; otherwise the allusione would lack point 'l'he Captivi thus belonged
ιο tha latter part of Plautus' literary activity, if we are right in believing
this to have extended from about 204 ao, the probeble date of the usna
Gloriosus, ιο the death of the poet in 184 no. (The action of the pieoeie
described in the preliminary notes ιο the several Acts and Scenae)
