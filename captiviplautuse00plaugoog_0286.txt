Act 111. sane v. This Scene offers the strongest possible contrast
tc the bustling comedy 01 the last. The verse now becomes the lambio
80000100, 01 0 type far more free from resolved syllables than the ordinary
Senarius 01 Comedy. ln fact the matre, as well aa the language, of a great
part of the scene has more oi the tragic than the comic style. Not merely
the noble sentimenta 01 Tyndarus (vv. 683 sqq, 739 sqq), but also the
reproaches uttered by Hegio (vv. 670 sqq„ 761 sqq.) are expresscd in
measured, sonorous verse, which is inconsistent with any extravagance of
feeling or utterance. Hegio is not represented 00 ranting in 0 passionate
outburst of fury. He retains the dignified bearing that he displayed in
his first appearance on the stage though in this Scene the stern side,
as in Acti Sc. ii. the humorous side, 01 his character is revealed. His
concluding remarks in this Scene shew more sorrow than anger, and his

, tone throughout is one of righteous indignation, not of capricious passion.

The relationes this Scene to the last is similar to that 01 Sc. iii. to Sc. ii.
of Act ra A change of metre (from Trochaic septenarii to Iambic Senarii)‚
but not a change os speakers, marks the change 01 Scene. At the end
Tyndarus is led off to hard labour in the quantes.

669. The missing word can hardly bo macanos (Brix, Schoell), ior the
monicae are not chains, like the cctam maiores of v. 113. They are merely
the lora 01 v. 668.

660. Rogant, ‘what 0 question ! ’‚ a common nse, eg. 1101634 A. Quid
nln' 060 addam? B. Rogas? Sometimes rogitas takes the place of royac,
eg. Aul. 339 d Qui cero? B. Rogitas? 'l'he sentence which precedes is
usually a question with quis (quali, dre), and the sentence that follows is
usually a reply to this question, ag. spiri. 61 A. Aetolae heom...f
B. Rogas? Deperit. ”

661. sartor, the Ο. Lat. form 01 caesar, ‘a hoor‚' recurs in Varro
