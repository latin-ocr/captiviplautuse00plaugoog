se-cl. Some orell 01 these lines heve been bracketed by various
editors, but without good reason. It cannot indeed be denied thet our
MSS. frequently exhibit two versione of thesemo passage, one of which
odginsted from e later representation 01 0 play (see note on vv. 1016 sqq.).

Thus the Poenulus contains two versione of the Carthaginien passage
(vv. 9³0-ss and 940-9) and two versione of the end of the same play.

In the case of some dittographiee we can see that the one version was
adopted to the exclusion of the other in an early edition or recension
01 Plautus. For example, 000 01 the rival versione of the Carthaginien
passage (vv. 930-9) 10 omitted in the Ambrosian Palimpsest. More
commonly however both versione ere found incorporated in our MSS„
though there ere often indicatione that the one wes thet adopted by the
0001001 1000001οο which the archetype of the MSS. follows, while the other
ves subsequently jotted on 1110 margin, end only in process 01 11010 found
its way from the margin into 11101011 (See Introd. i ξ 17.)

Another kind of marginal adscript that was liable to be found in
ancient copies of Plautus may be exemplified from the curicus history
of an English play, Sir John Van Oldca namnet, by Maeeinger end
110101100110 passage which strongly suggested Milton's line “That last
infirmity 01 noble mind,” an editor had jotted this linem the margin.
'l’his jotting the printer incorporated with 1110 101100 that the passage
appears in thie edition' 10 thie form:

“Read but’ oer the storias
Of men most femed for courage or for counseile,
And you shall find that the desire 01 glory
(That last infirmity 01 noble minda)
Was 1110 1001 frailty which men e'er put off.”

Alina 1110148 excites the suspicion thet it is a parallel passage, taken
from a similer situation in another play and jotted in the margin of some
early text, whether by a private owner for his own convenience or by an
editor for the information of readers3 for marginal adscripts, it must be
membered, corresponded to the footnotes in modern editione. On the
011101 hand, if we picture to ourselvee the circumstances under which the
prologus to this play would be spoken end remember that the garridous
prolixity 01 Plautus, 11100011 ustrinae 1000111 101 which Horace censuras
11101,οω in ceses like thie the only means of impressing on en unin-
tellectual and heedless audience some important incident 01 0 compliceted
plot, we shall 1001 11 10 be the safer courseto leave the passage as it stands
in 1110 MSS.
