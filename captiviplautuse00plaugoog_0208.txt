The word here refers to the third member of the compormd name, vir.

tlenmroctrpsoaico, ‘omsqucror of mensures of gold,' and should not be
explained aethe equivalent of avaritia on the strength of Paul Fest 15.

00 Tu Araduciu ab amite, id est capide, agendo est dictu. Paulus is rather
aceounting for the etymology from avidm than communiceting from early
literature an obsoleto sense of the Noun

288. Hegio does not know the real name till v. 635, so that this
remark of Philocrates must be en ‘aside' to the audience, uttered, we
may suppose, while Hegio, reflecting on this new piece of informatiom
tekes e step away from him We have no reason to suppose that stage-
directions like our ‘aride’ were entered in ancient editions of Plautus
'l'he few traces that we find in our MSS, eg. Aa. 60 “loc recum loquitar,'’
may have been udded in mediaevel times Illic (Adv.) quidem can
hardly be e scribe’s corruption of ille quidm (the reading substituted by
Luchs), for s scribe would not change a familiar to an unfamiliar form,
though it may be of illi (Adv.) quidem (cf. ad v. 60). Iuro quidem seems
not to occur in Plautus, but only ille quidem (eg, v. 573).

289. Quid tu ais? (referring to v. 287). See note on w. 990. Per-
tenax. Compounds with per in its intensive sense were ‘Separable’
Compounds (cf per pol scope peccas Ces 370); and the vowel of the simple
stem did not suffer weekening, so thet perpende isa preferable spelling to
pertinax. Lucilius twitted Scipio Africanus Minor with his affected use of
patriminstesd ofpertuem (inc. 169 Μ.);

Quo facetior uideare, et scire plus quam ceteri,

‘Pertisum’ hominem, non pertaesum, dices
Percussum is the spelling on the Lyons tablet of the Emperor Claudius,
a purist in these matters.

290. Ut magis. See note on ul facilius v. 33. Ubi quando.
Quando seems here to be indefinite, ‘ut any time' as in adpreende (eg. Cato
R. Il„ 101. «l, 157. 10). cf. Sticla 201 Ei quando quem acchonem factumne
dum, Adeunt, perquirant quid sict ccmo ilico.
