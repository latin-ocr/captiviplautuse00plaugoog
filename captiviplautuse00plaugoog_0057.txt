⁴ Naevius, and probably only in their nondramatic writinga To
Plautus, in whose time the tinal d aiter a long vowel (except in nied,
ed, θ 5) seems to have been as definitely dropped in pronuncia·
tion as our final b in ‘lamb,' the use of such a form in his lines
which were reproductions of the language ol everyday liic was im·
possible. Cicero's statement must be accepted as an expression oi the
opinion oi competent criticism in tbe last century of the Republic,
that hiatus was a feature of early, in contrast to contemporary, poetry.

36. Now this opinion is one that cannot be arbitrarily put
asida. Ritschl'a attempt to restrict hiatus in Plautus within the
narrow limita to which Terence seems to confine it (see Leo
Puer. d'orsch. 3), involves too much tampering with the MSS. (ci.
Klotz Gruadzu'ye, p. 14). Why should we accept tbc evidence ol the
MSS. ior line aiter line and reject it as soon as an hiatus appearsl

One anawer to this question has recently been given which
would throw discouragement on our efforts to discover Plautus’ usage
in regard to hiatus It is said¹ that the earliest eduen oi the
works oi Plautus was made at that archaizing period in the Early
Empire, when the belief that each and every iorm os histos was
tolerated in the archaic poetry shewed itseli in the verses written in
imitat-ion oi the early style'. And it is argued that the editors,
while they would use the resources then available to them, but now
lost to us, in remedying other deiecta oi tha lines, would make no
attempt to remedy a line which suffered from hiatus. They would
not recognize hiatus as a defeat. So when our MSS. (APA) agree
in exhibiting a line with hiatus, we should not, it is urged, believe
that this is the iorm in which Plautus wrote the line, but we should
accept it as a corrupt form, which might have been emended by the
ancient editors with the help oi the materiale at their command, but
which we at this late period can hardly hope to emend

This theory, it appears to me, may. like its neighbour-theory
oi the close connexion of our two earliest MSS„ A and P* (above,

as a rule anemended all linea whose only defeot ia Hiatus, even those ior which
we have only the evidence oi P, a single mediacval MS. (i. g 3). Since mediaaval
