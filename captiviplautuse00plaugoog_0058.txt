ch i. 5 18), be disproved by an examinatiou 01 the facts 11 we find
that the instances of hiatus on which our Mes, agree, admit 01
being gmuped round one 01 two types, and that these types 01 hiatus
have in themselves an intrinsic probability, then we shall have
grounds ior ascribing the hiatus to Plautus himself. 01 course the
two ancient recensione which these MSS. represent may hum the
first have shared in a certain number, probably a very limited
number (13 18), 01 corrupt readings which left a ialse hiatus in
this or that line ; while other corruptions (especially the ‘moderni-
ustiou' 01 1111111111 forms 1111111110 Nom, 11111 Ι)11., illunc, horunc,

ipen med, ted, 1111) may have found their way at different perinde
into the one text aud the other with the same result. But while 111
this malros the discovery 01 Plautus’ actual rules 01 Η11111 1 difficult
task‚ it does not by any means make it impossible.

'l'hat Latin h had 11 some early (probably very early) period a strouger souud
(01. dialectal sortis lor hostis, like our dialectal ‘thos' 101 ‘theuph’l thau it had

have retained this in Plautus' time (cl. 1 15), and cannot accept the theory that
initial hmay disqualily elision iu Plautina verse. (Birt in liteintrches Murcum,
11140, gives 11111 list 01 avallabla pmsages.) Plautus left hiatus 11, eg„ ‘qui
amat' 11 readily as iu, ag.. ‘qui habet)

37. Under what circumstances then do we find Hiatus in the
1111101 Plautus, 10 strongly supported by the evidence 01 MSS. and
by anmogy 11011 other Latin poetry or by ί1111011001111111111011,
