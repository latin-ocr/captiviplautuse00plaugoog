188. 1134 A. ige muts 88 ac ru 81 me ad senam-B. Dte nanu·
rum ; quid tacesl (octo MSS, istaec, te Ritsohl, fort istaes
tu).

ln one of these passages (Cas. 208) the form istaec is required by the metm
in another (the line under discussion) either the form istaec or some change
of the reading of the MSS. is required; in two (Aria 860 and 578) the
change of isto to setoso is supported by the traditional text„ and in the
remaining three the removal of the doubtful form is affected without
violence to the MSS. (eg. in Amph 589 the loss of ec before er· cf sepem
'rs very natural).

On ‘b priori’ grounds there is no objection to the forms istud and r'sts
Since iliad is in use along with illac, illo nlong with illaec, we should ba
prepared to accept istud and ista es 88 least occasionel bysorms, ifthe
evidence of the MSS. were sufficient That evidence however, iseme-
fully examined‚ seems to me to pronounce so strongly against these forms,
that we are driven to the conclusion that by some caprice of language,
eistad end 888 were not admitted to the diction of Plautus and Terence
Leo retains ista in this line and adds oc before dir. But the besetting sin
of scribes was rather the effacing of tha Early Latin Asyndeton in such
ceses (see note on v. 658). Both auser (dic.) dic (do) (eg. Poea. 1085
Maledicta ltine aufer, linquam compescas soce) and aufer (duc) ac dic (da)
(eg. 081. 747 Sal quaeso ambages, mulier, mitto otqroe doc ayo) were
permissible expressions in Plautus (see note on v. 540). A corruption in
a MS. would take the form of the insertion os atque or oc rather thanol
the omission of the copula. lndeed so frequent is this insertion ss to
suggest a certain amount ol doubt about eny line where the copule is
not required by tho metro. Hence Coro. 245 (quoted above) is not so
satisfactory evidence os the use of the copule as Oiai. 747, and the remorrl
of the copula in Ario. 578, Most. 1134 is a method of emendation tc which
exception cannot be taken.

965. Dictis uolo conpendium. This reading involves the least
possible departure from tho MSS, which offer dicre o. uolo. Since thr
us construction in Plautus is aliquid compendi fucere (Aria 307, Bacch
18 ‚Moat 60, Pers. 471, Poer. 351, Porri. 1141, Puto. 376), most editors
rewrite the phrase in this form, dicta cooperarii uolo. But wehnve other
instanoes in Plautus of departure from the nor-mul form of the phrase:
