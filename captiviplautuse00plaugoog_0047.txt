20. (2) Polysyllabio words. A syllable with naturally short
vowel is often not lengthened by ‘position' before a oonsonantr
group‚ when the following syllable (occasionally the preceding)
bears the accenh oi the word, and when the preceding syllable is
short, eg. ministeriam, uoldptatem, addptataa dddptaticias (Poen
1045).

No mehler what that greup may he, eg. rn in gubernabant, nt in uolantem,
11 in ministeriam, 1111111111ίώ in supellectilium in 11111111ιί11. 11 is wrong 1ο
say that the shortening is espeoially round before a double eonsensnt, ag. 11, aa,
and to argue from the mere orthographioal practice ol writing a double conso
nant single in early Latin (as in early Greek) inscriptions thatthe pronunciation
ol a double consonant was wsalror in the early than in the olaasloal period
Nor does the division ol the two consonante between different syllables, ag.
111, alc, 111, or the inolusion ol both in the same syllable, ag. 111, make any per·
eaptihla diflerenoe. Statiellae ol this shortsning in polysyllabis words are given
by Esoh: de Plauti correptione secandae syllabae vocabulorum polysyllaboma
qaae mensura iambica incipiant. Mfinshsr, 1997.

The instances of shorhening a naturally long vowel in such
words are very rare, but perhaps too well attested to be pub asido,
ag. pudiciciam (Amph. 930, Epid. 405), verebamini Phorm. 902
(1.1. veremini), Clytaemestra Liv. Andr. Troy. ll R.

Shortenings like calefacere are common enough. But they belong aa much

1ο the elasa of iambis words as af polysyllahlas. We may write calefacere (of.
Βυο1.11.969 et facit are) or calefacere, as heae facere or benefacere. (ll. di!-

quince (Gall. x. 24), videlicet (ag. Stich. 5573 but 1111Αεί1. 5991. For a rull
list ol instanoes like pudicicia, see Skutsch, lantheakilrzaay aad Syaisese in
‘Satara Viadriaa,' Breslau 1996. Eseh however disallows them (16101111.
Phil. xxii. 1).

With these polysyllahic words we may associate

21. (3) Polysyllahic wordgroups. The phrase uoluptas ntea,
‘my darling,' seems ho have been pronounoed ae a single word, like
respublica or jusjurandum, with aocenh on the antepenultimate
syllable of hhe compound, i.e. on the last syllable of voluptas. The
preceding syllable is invariably scanned short by Plautus, uoluptas·

mea. Similar word-groups that occasionally exhibih the action ol
the Law of Breves Breviantes are: molestae-seat (Mil. 69); procidati-
