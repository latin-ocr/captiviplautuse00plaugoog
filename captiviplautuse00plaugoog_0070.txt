to exist when the Athenian Empire fell. The New Comedy re
strieted itsell to ‘dialoguemetres,' especially the Iambic Trimeter.
In Menander indeed there are traces oi Anapaestic passages (ior
details see Blase in Hernico xxxiii. 655) 3 but, so iar as the extant
irngments allow us tc judge, this metra was used to a very limited
extent. Moreover Menander and Diphilus are mentioned as having
employed tbe ‘Metram Eupolideum' (Mar. Vict. p. 104, 4 Κ.) ;
and the ‘Versus Diphilius' takes its name irem Diphilns; but yet
Plautus cannot be supposed tc have derived his wealth oi metre

from these poeta The Miles dcccc, probably one oi the earliest
oi Plantns' plays, with its exclusive use ο1 Iambic and Trochaic

metrae, except in one Anapaestic passage (vv. loll-1093), seems
tc give a fairly correct impression oi the N ev Comedy type. Sc dc

although both he and Plautus are charged with a iar more extended
use cf Tetrometers then they found in their originals¹. Of Plautue’
plays we may add the Aenaria (ist-137 Oratio), and the Mercator
(vv. sss-363 Bacchiae end Anapaestic), which are almost wholly
expreseed in Iambics and Trochaics, whereas in a play like the
oasim nearly every actor is provided with a song. The cantica in
Roman adaptatione froin the N ev Comedy thus appear tn have been
an element added from some foreign source in obedienoe tc the
dmmstic requirements cf the time. In Plautus the cantica are
monodies‚ not part-scngs oi a chorus², so that a derivation of them
