⁸4⁸. Bitechl’s theory that stricter laws oi Prosody were observed in some
matres than in others can hardly stand. It is true that in (iretis and Bacchiae
passages the Low ci Breves Breviantes has very limited operation, mainly
δοοιοοο the nature oi these matres was adapted lor iambus-words rather than
pyrrioh-words (iii. ξς 27-8, 36Ι; and in Anapacstic lines the scansion of a Oratio

E. Hiatus.
35. Cicero, speaking of the earlier Roman poete, says (orator

xlv. loti: Sed Graeci viderint3 nobis, ne si cupiamus quidem,
distrahere voces conceditur. indicant orationes illae ipsae horridulae
Ontonia, indicent omnes poetae praeter ecs, qui, ut versum facerent,
saepe hiabant, ut Naevius:

at Ennius semel (al. saepe): ‘Scipio Ι inuicte,' et quidem nos: ‘boc
motu radiantia Etesiae Ι in vada ponti.’ hoc idem nostri saepius
non tulissent, quod Graeci laudare etiam solent.

It has been suggested that the loss oi el from tbe termination
oi Ablatives Singular would leave an appearance of hiatus, a false
ορροοηιιοο, ιο a critic oi Gioero's time, just as the disuse oi the
Digamma gave Alexandrian critice a wrong impression of Homer’s
tolerance oi hiatus. N ο doubt a line like the Saturnian of Naevius:

would, ii written with the current form Troia, instead of the form
actually used by Naevius, give the impression that Naevius had

Cicero's verdict isin some part based on a misapprehension oi this
kind But it is impossible to explain it all away iu this iashion.
The instances which Cicero quotes are not instancee of Ablative
forms followed by eceming hiatus. And Abi. forms with finald
would be iound only in the earliest poetry, the poetry oi Livius and
